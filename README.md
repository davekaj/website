# Simple Personal Website

This is an HTML and CSS only, simple personal website.
It is hosted with github pages to make it as low-tech as possible.
It is served from the main branch to [davekajpust.com](https:/www.davekajpust.com).
## Testing

Github pages is not very dynamic, and it's annoying to setup a testing environment.
So just launch the folder with `open -a "Google Chrome" index.html"` to test.
Once that is done, you can create a PR with the branch, and merge it to `main`.
