        I am a founder and blockchain engineer working in crypto since 2017.
        Currently, I am working as an independent researcher and collaborating
        on open-source software in the Ethereum Ecosystem. I'm
        focusing on DeFi and other financial innovations that will shape the
        future of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe strongly in the tenants of decentralization and open-source software. We cannot take shortcuts. We must build a parallel financial system that is open and accessible to all, and out of control from centralized authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm looking to collaborate with other engineers and
        researchers on open-source projects.
        <b> If you are interested in collaborating, please reach out.</b>

      <h1>Why Ethereum and DeFi?</h1>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Ethereum because it sticks true to the ethos of decentralization better than any other blockchain.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm drawn to DeFi, seeing it as blockchain's pivotal innovation
            poised to challenge both commercial and central banks. While the
            internet reshaped most sectors, banking remained untouched due to
            strict regulations. Now, with central banks printing vast sums and
            the rise of CBDCs capable of monitoring our spending, we tread on
            unsettling ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also am excited in other financial innovations that don't fall
            under DeFi. I believe there will be many categories of financial
            innovation with blockchains, such as DeFi, OpenFi, and
            <a href="https://cofi.informal.systems/">CoFi</a>, which I have

        Founder, CEO and CTO. Grew to a team of 9 people. After 1 year we shut
        it down before launching a product. We moved too slow and did not
        innovate enough on decentralized stablecoins.

        I was the seventh hire on the team, and the first smart contract
