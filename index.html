            I am a founder and blockchain engineer working in crypto since 2017. I focus solely on Decentralized Finance
            (DeFi). Currently, I am writing as an independent researcher and collaborating on open-source software. I
            work with Ethereum and Cosmos projects because I believe they will become the dominant platforms in the
            blockchain industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            My current focus is determining how DeFi will shift in the coming years as the industry matures. Once I
            strengthen my hypothesis on what the future will look like, I will create or join a startup to serve this
            new direction.

        <h1>DeFi</h1>
        <div>
            Why am I focused on DeFi?
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Central banking is a rigged game where the rich and elite can decide how to print money, and who
                        it should go to. Controlling money is the largest control mechanism that elites have outside of
                        war. <b>We need to design new monetary systems outside of central banking that make money an
                            open
                            and fair game to play for all citizens from all countries.</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As we solve the problem explained above, blockchains simultaneously provide us with open
                        algorithms that will put identity, privacy, knowledge, voting, data, and reputation back in the
                        hands of the people and create a <b>Modern Internet Democracy</b>. Right now we live in a modern
                        internet age, yet we are governed by a 200-year-old democracy. <b>With blockchain, we can turn
                            the Internet from a tool for authoritarian control into a tool for decentralized
                            democracy</b>
                    </li>
            </div>
            Where do I think DeFi is headed?
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I believe that most DeFi protocols are not fully decentralized, and that we need to better
                        define the categories of protocols, which I have outlined in my blog - <a
                            href="https://medium.com/@davekaj/crypto-the-escape-hatch-for-the-global-financial-system-ef544b42ff52">Crypto
                            — The Escape Hatch
                            For The Broken Global Financial
                            System.</a>
                    </li>
            </div>
            <div>
                I propose separating DeFi into two categories immediately:
                <ul>

                    <li>
                        <b>Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</b> - <i>a set of permissionless, public, peer-to-peer financial
                            protocols that are open-source, have no owners, and involve no third parties.</i>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Open Finance (OpenFi)</b> - <i>companies or DAOs that offer financial services built
                            entirely
                            upon permissionless, public, peer-to-peer financial protocols.</i>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                Furthermore, we need to define completely new monetary systems. DeFi and OpenFi both treat money
                the exact same way we do in traditional finance, only with different degrees of
                decentralization.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
                With new financial technology, we can completely rethink how we treat money. <b>This rethinking
                    of how we use money, and what money is at its core, is what I am most interested in and
                    currently working on.</b> The best example I have seen of this is <a
                    href="https://cofi.informal.systems/about">Collaborative
                    Finance from Informal Systems</a>. I believe CoFi has an
                excellent shot at redefining how we treat money. If not CoFi, then I am 100% convinced there
                will be at least one successful project that redefines money in the next decade, and will shape
                global finance for the next century.
