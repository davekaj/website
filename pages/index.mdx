# Dave Kajpust
Welcome to my website. It's really just a blog and a short bio. I'll mainly write about Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and broader blockchain topics. I'll sprinkle in some philosophical writing once in a while.

I've been in crypto as a blockchain developer since 2017, and I will be working in DeFi for the next decade and beyond. DeFi is the most promising technology we can build with blockchains that can give us an immediate 10x improvement on all banking and money infrastructure, as well as our entire money system with central banks. There is no doubt in my mind this is world-changing technology.

My long-term vision for crypto is that DeFi will be the conduit that leads us to build a new version of The Internet, but with privacy preservation at the core. This will allow us to build new governance systems, solve coordination problems, communicate privately, create online identity systems, and much more.

## Current work
I am the founder of [Ekonomia](https://ekonomia.tech), a DeFi crypto startup. The main focus of work is [Photon Finance](https://photon.finance), which is a decentralized stablecoin currently in development. It will improve upon the stablecoin space by offering a modular, governance-minimized, and fairly distributed protocol.

You can follow updates on the project [here](https://medium.com/photonfinance).

## Past work and education
I graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Manitoba. As a student I worked on composite material engineering, and at an oil sands refinery in Alberta. After graduating, I travelled around the world for 8 months, and then settled in Toronto, Canada. I worked as a Mech Engineer, but I knew it wasn't the right path and quit after a year. I started to teach myself how to code on nights and weekends.

Around this time, I got very interested in blockchains. I started teaching myself Solidity, as it was brand new, and it was the fastest path I saw to get into the blockchain space. A few months later, I started as a developer at [Polymath](https://polymath.network).

After Polymath, I began working on [The Graph Protocol](https://thegraph.com) smart contracts. The protocol was launched in December 2020, and then I continued to do work related to The Graph with [Edge and Node](https://edgeandnode.com) in 2021.

## Other
I grew up in Winnipeg, a small-ish, cold city in the Canadian Prairies.

In my spare time, I like to stay fit - crossfit is my main focus. I fit in tennis and skiing when I can. I read a lot too, mostly psychology and finance books as of late.

I used to blog on Medium, and you can find my old blog posts [here](https://medium.com/@davekaj). All of my new writing will be posted to this site going forward.
