# Dave Kajpust

I am a founder and blockchain engineer working in crypto since 2017. I focus solely on Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Currently, I am writing as an independent researcher and collaborating on open-source software. I work with Ethereum and Cosmos projects because I believe they will become the dominant platforms in the blockchain industry.

My current focus is determining how DeFi will shift in the coming years as the industry matures. Once I strengthen my hypothesis on what the future will look like, I will create or join a startup to serve this new direction.

## Why focus on DeFi?

Two reasons:

- Central banking is a rigged game where the rich and elite can decide where the money goes and how much flows. Control over money is the by far the largest control mechanism that elites have outside of war. **We need to design new monetary systems outside of central banking that make money an open and fair game to play for all citizens from all countries.**
- As we solve the problem explained above, blockchains simultaneously provide us with open algorithms that will put identity, privacy, knowledge, voting, data, and reputation back in the hands of the people and create **Modern Internet Democracy**. Right now we live in a modern internet age, yet we are governed by a 200-year-old democracy. **With blockchain, we can turn the Internet from a tool for authoritarian control into a tool for decentralized democracy.**

## Where do I think DeFi is headed?

I believe that most DeFi protocols are not fully decentralized, and that we need to better define the categories of protocols, which I have outlined in my blog [Crypto — The Escape Hatch For The Broken Global Financial System](https://medium.com/@davekaj/crypto-the-escape-hatch-for-the-global-financial-system-ef544b42ff52).

I propose separating DeFi into two categories immediately:

- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** - _a set of permissionless, public, peer-to-peer financial protocols that are open-source, have no owners, and involve no third parties._
- **Open Finance (OpenFi)** - _companies or DAOs that offer financial services built entirely upon permissionless, public, peer-to-peer financial protocols._

Furthermore, we need to define completely new monetary systems. DeFi and OpenFi both treat money the exact same way we do in traditional finance, only with different degrees of decentralization.

With new financial technology, we can completely rethink how we treat money. **This rethinking of how we use money, and what money is at its core, is what I am most interested in and currently working on.** The best example I have seen of this is [Collaborative Finance](https://cofi.informal.systems/about), which Informal Systems is working on. I believe CoFi has an excellent shot at redefining how we treat money.

I am 100% convinced that there will be at least one successful project that redefines money in the next decade. If not CoFi, it will be another project.
