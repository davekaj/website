# Dave Kajpust

Hello! My name is Dave. I grew up in [Winnipeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg), a freezing cold city in the Canadian praeries. I like to stay active, today that mostly involves playing tennis and doing crossfit. I read about finance and psychology, I write code, and I have been working in the blockchain space since 2017. Currently, I am working on Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for the foreseeable future.

I used to blog on Medium, and you can find my old blog posts [here](https://medium.com/@davekaj). All new material will be posted to this site going forward.

## My Past

I graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Manitoba. As a student I worked on composite material engineering, and at an oil sands refinery in Alberta. After graduating, I travelled around the world for 8 months, and then settled in Toronto, Canada. And I have been here ever since! I worked one year as a Mech Engineer, but I knew it wasn't the right path. I started coding at night and on weekends, and I loved it so much I quit a month later.

It was around this time I also got very interested in blockchains. I started teaching myself Solidity, as it was a brand new, and it was the fastest path I saw to get into the blockchain space. A few months later, I started writing code for [Polymath](https://polymath.network).

After Polymath, I began working on [The Graph Protocol](https://thegraph.com) smart contracts. The protocol was launched in December 2020, and then I continued to do work related to The Graph with [Edge and Node](https://edgeandnode.com) in 2021.

## Current Work

Currently I am working on a DeFi protocol, that is yet to be announced.
