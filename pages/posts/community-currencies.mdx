# How Community Currencies will enable the creation of new local economic systems

The global economic machine is broken, wasteful, and harms people all over the world by whipsawing their finances and economic well-being with crashes and rallies. In 2021 we are experiencing global supply chain issues like never before.

It is extremely difficult to fix - the global economy is a [complex system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system). We have top-down organizations such as G7 governments and global think tanks that put together "master plans" to solve the world's problems. However I don't believe any top-down master plan will be sustainable or realistic in a system as complex as the global economy.

For example, a Country may have a stable and wealthy upper class, but a struggling middle and lower class. The US has faced this complex problem for many years, and no solution has been found. The top 1% are much wealthier than the bottom 50%, and it has been getting increasingly worse over the last 40 years.

Countries adopting renewable energy is also a complex problem to solve. A oil producing country like Canada might slow down oil production and cancel major projects. But the world demand for energy continues to go up. Like a game of whack-a-mole, when one country stops producing another will ramp up production.

These complex problems need new systems that evolve from bottom-up tinkering and improvement, with little to no intervention from bureaucratic organizations. [Local Circular Economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy), Startup Cities and Cloud Countries are all systems that are being experimented with today, and can exist in tandem alongside the global economic system. They can provide better system for people by decoupling financial growth and financial stability.

**One thing all these systems have in common is that real economic experiments are being carried out today because of Community Currenices, which have become easy to create and deploy because of advances made in blockchain and open source technology over the last 5 years.**

Surprisingly, Community Currencies are not often discussed in the blockchain industry. Yet I believe they will be the driving force behind the most impactful changes in local and global economics in the next decade.

In this post we'll dig into what Community Currencies are and how they compare to Network Currencies. Then we'll go into the new economic systems they enable and how it will change local and global economies.

## Community and Network Currencies

To describe Community Currencies, it helps to describe the opposite as well. The opposite is what we are familar with - fiat currencies, bitcoin, ether, etc. In this post I refer to them as **Network Currencies**.
Let's describe both types below:

- _Network Currency_ - A currency that is used by a large, diverse group of individuals and organizations. **It is designed to benefit from network effects, and to grow at all costs. It sacrifices stability to obtain growth.**
- _Community Currency_ - A currency that is used by a small, well-defined group of individuals and organizations. **It is designed with a limit to its size and usage. It will sacrifice growth to obtain stability.**

In the 20th and 21st centuries, we have been conditioned to trade, barter, and exchange in Network Currencies due to the global economy. Countries took a centralized role in our lives and completely monopolized the economy for themselves. This ultimately lead to a total dependency on Fiat Currencies- and eventually to the Global, interconnected economy we have today. // CONTINUE

As a result, we have all been forced into economies that fluctuate and whipsaw with instability. We are going through a particularly unstable and turbulent time in the 2020s, which was kicked into high gear by the COVID crisis, and the War in Ukraine.

Luckily, Bitcoin has given us an escape route from the broken global economy. **It has set the stage for Community Currencies to do the same in the next decade. There will be a renaissance of small, local economies that are resistant to global economic crashes. There will be thousands of large-scale Community Currencies, and millions of small-scale or temporary Community Currencies.**

**They will shine in their ability to provide stability and create regenerative, circular economies.** This will happen alongside Network Currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum while they compete with Fiat currencies for global growth.

## Centralization vs. Decentralization

It is worth pointing out that Network and Community Currencies can be both centralized and decentralized, and that's okay. Fully decentralized currencies have more potential, because they didn't exist before and are filling a large void. But a coin that is deliberately, and honestly centralized, is totally fine. It's more like a traditional business. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

**Decentralized Network Currencies**

- Bitcoin and Ethereum are the gold standard. I will not go into more detail as their strong decentralization properties are common knowledge.

**Centralized Network Currencies**

- The perfect example for a Centralized Network Currency is Binance’s BNB. Binance is on the path to becoming a global bank, and they will follow government regulations, and it BNB will not have one ounce of decentralization in it. But that's okay! I consider Centralized Network Currencies to be fulfilling the original vision of "Fintech". Fintech was unable to change anything significant in banking because startups had to follow strict banking regulations, and large banks had become "too big to fail", thus creating a stale, and slow-moving financial technology sector. Binance, and BNB, will just replace the role of local and national banks.
- Fiat Currencies are also Centralized Network Currencies, as the government or the central bank has root access to change the supply and rates at will.

**Centralized Community Currencies**

- Many Community Currencies will have characteristics of centralization. For example, Having a Proof of Authority (POA) network for a village or city of fewer than 10,000 people makes a lot of sense. The community is so small, it does not need to achieve the level of decentralization that Bitcoin has.
- It should be open and transparent to the members of the community.
- It can be open and transparent to members outside of the community. If not, there is no incentive for non-members to ever hold the currency. This is not a hard requirement, sometimes groups will want their own internal currency.
- It can be temporary as well - designed to last only one week or one day.

**Decentralized Community Currencies**

- A Decentralized Community Currency is tougher to comprehend. A City Coin is a good example. Imagine anyone can buy the New York City Token. The token would have different use cases if you lived in NYC, compared to if you were a tourist visiting.
- Because the token is open, transparent, and decentralized, a tourist should feel confident they can buy and hold $NYCT, and not get rug pulled by the city leaders.

Let's now dive into real examples of Network and Community Currencies to paint a more colorful picture.

## Network Currencies in Depth

Let's discuss the USD, its benefits, and its problems. Then we will elaborate on Bitcoin.

### USD

**Benefits**

- It is the Global Reserve Currency, and having a global settlement currency allows for countries to have a common asset to exchange. It also gives every country a benchmark to compare their own currency too.
- Every Fiat currency gives the Country the ability to control its money supply.

**Problems**

- Crises lead to violent crashes, which lead to fiscal and monetary intervention, which lead to slow, uneven recoveries.
- Fiscal and monetary intervention seems to have very little impact in being able to soften the blow from
- Inflation seems to always come
- The Federal Reserve has closed door meetings, where a small group of people decide how much to inflate the USD. This can inflate the currency extremely fast - and cause harships to business operations and people's savings. It effects billions of people because of the USD's status as the world reserve currency

</div>

### Bitcoin

**Benefits**

- Common global currency that any country or person can settle it.
- It can serve as a common benchmark for everyone to measure their own assets against.
- Anyone around the world with an internet connection can buy it.
- A rigid monetary policy - the total supply is stuck at 21 million, and the inflation is set to half every four years.
- It is the most decentralized cryptocurrency in the world when considering all factors.

**Problems**

- Very prone to bubbles.
- Inflexible. Although this can be a benefit and a problem, depending on the argument.
- Early adopters hold a large amount, and due to the rigidity of bitcoins monetary policy, there is no clear way to distribute BTC to future adopters.
- The network is too slow for a global payments system. This has led to the "Bitcoin is a store of wealth" narrative.

Ethereum is also a good example of a Network Currency and has different benefits and problems than Bitcoin. It is good that Ethereum is taking a different angle than Bitcoin. There are many other cryptocurrencies also trying to compete as a Network Currency, but ETH and BTC are miles ahead of them all.

## Community Currencies in Depth

Community Currencies are less understood by the general population and even people who work in the blockchain industry. A good place to start learning more in-depth on this topic is [Ethan Buchman's blog](https://ebuchman.github.io), specifically the post [Local Money and Liquidity Saving](https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/local-money-liquidity-saving/). But there are many other posts that relate to the concept, as well as some of his [videos](https://ebuchman.github.io/media/). Ethan is one of the founders of [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/). If you read deeper into his writing you'll see how the Cosmos Technology is the best tech to enable Community Currencies.

A Community Currency is used by a group of defined size, used for a variety of purposes. Some examples:

- It can be used to create a [circular economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy) that promotes recycling, reuse, and sharing in the economy.
- It can be used as a [complementary currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_currency) to allow a local economy to have its own currency, and gain more control over stability, the velocity of money, and supporting local businesses.
- It can be a City Coin, used for spending, voting, or services within the city.
- And many more.

To highlight the broad range of possibilities, let's go through some real examples that exist today.

### ETH Denver, SporkDAO, and $SPORK

[ETH Denver](https://www.ethdenver.com/) is an annual event in February that started in 2018. They [created a community known as SporkDAO](https://medium.com/ethdenver/sporkdao-token-economics-spork-rewards-5d0c1aaa0ba6), explained below:

_SporkDAO has been birthed to complete the evolution of ETHDenver from a wholly owned, centrally controlled entity to a Member-owned digital cooperative. $SPORK is the incentive alignment mechanism that will be used to govern SporkDAO along with being the unit of account for calculating distribution of profits to SporkDAO members should that time come._

Reading through their plans for $SPORK, it's clear that this is a community currency.

    <a target="_blank">
      Source - SporkDAO Token Economics and $SPORK Rewards
    </a>
  </Link>
</div>

$SPORK was rewarded to people who have participated in past ETH Denver events, and there are plans to distribute $SPORK to encourage future membership, and $SPORK will be used to govern the DAO. [REFERENCE]

$SPORK might look pretty small right now, and doesn't trade with any real volume on decentralized exchanges. But this is just the start! $SPORK has a ton of opportunities to be used in the future. Some examples:

- Require ETH Denver sponsors to buy $SPORK tokens, burn them, or stake them for a period of time.
- ETH Denver was oversubscribed and had long lines for non-hackers in 2022. SporkDAO could give people the option to spend $SPORK for fast entry.
- SporkDAO could expand to new cities outside of Denver, and use $SPORK to incentivize this growth.

During ETH Denver, participants get Food Tokens to spend at food trucks stationed outside the event. In 2022 they were simply ERC-20 tokens on the Rinkeby Testnet. Each token represented about $10 USD. The Food Truck owners then got to exchange the tokens for real money with the ETH Denver organizers after the end of the event.

Food Tokens are an example of a **Temporary Community Currency**. It only needed to exist for 4 days and helped circulate money in an easy way. Because of its temporary, low-risk nature, it operated on a testnet, which made every transaction free. **When people talk of millions of Community Currencies being created in the future, they should have the image of Temporary, low-risk currencies in their mind.**

Again, this is a super small example! But what is so amazing about this is we have created open-source technology that allows this to be adopted by any community worldwide. It will continue to get easier to allow this to happen. One day anyone with an internet connection will be able to create a temporary community currency from their phone in a few clicks.

### Grassroots Economics

[Grassroots Economics](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/pages/about-us.html) is a non-profit foundation that is empowering marginalized communities to be able to take control of their own economic future. They have been around for over a decade, and have boots on the ground in low-income rural communities. They have been working on community currencies for a long time, and they have begun to leverage blockchain and open source technology to their benefit. They explain here how they intended to use [blockchain technology](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/open-tech-questions-answers.html). What I love is that they don't treat blockchains as something used to speculate with, or to claim it will solve all the problems of the local community. They simply use it as a tool in their arsenal to help improve these people's economic lives. It's a breath of fresh air!

</div>

They have created the [Sarafu Network](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/pages/sarafu-network.html), which leverages blockchain tech to create local currencies. Sarafu (SRF), is used as a basic income, as well as a common token that local communities can bridge to with their own currencies - known as Community Inclusion Currencies.

In essence, many small communities can make their own currencies. These then bridge up to SRF, which allows them to interact with many nearby local economies. As adoption grows, SRF could bridge to a Fiat currency like the Kenyan Shilling. With blockchain technology such as bonding curves, we could have seamless integration of community currencies bridging up to Network Currencies, and back down!

Community Currencies have flexibility in how closed loop they want to be. You could argue that a Community Currency should be fully closed loop, and cannot be exchanged for Kenyan Shillings, and that would be fine! But if the local communities wanted their currencies to grow in adoption, they could create this opening to exchange their currencies for fiat. This then brings in more risk, but the potential for more growth. **The key part here is that the communities get to decide how intertwined they want their Community Currencies to be with other currencies.**

### CityDAO and CityCoins

Cities having their own coins feel like the largest meat-space Community Currency that can exist. For a great primer on the potential for City Coins, checkout @balajis's tweet thread:

<div>
  <blockquote className="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Buy Miami, short SF.<br/>Or, if you believe in the turnaround, go long SF.<br/>Citycoins will express people&#39;s faith in city policy. As does emigration. Vote with ballot, and now also with wallet and feet. <a href="https://t.co/UYE1FeEFa1">https://t.co/UYE1FeEFa1</a></p>&mdash; Balaji Srinivasan (@balajis) <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1400701895824400384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charSet="utf-8"></script>
</div>

There are a lot of opportunities described in that thread, and next, we will focus on two projects that are working on a few of those opportunities.

[CityDAO](https://www.citydao.io/) is a project that is exploring on-chain land ownership. They began by buying a parcel of land in Wyoming and auctioning off the NFT. The DAO is managed by the community, and Wyoming was chosen as it created a law in 2021 that recognizes DAOs legal entities. **This is a city from scratch approach. Completely avoiding the bureaucracy and resistance in an existing city that will slow down the adoption of technology.** It is an audacious goal, but I 100% believe we will see successful cities created this way within the next 20 years.

[Citycoins](https://www.citycoins.co/) **is a project that creates a token for an existing city**. They use an interesting approach - they get no approval or partnership with the city to start. They allow for a grassroots movement of citizens and/or speculators to mine the token. In order to mine the token, they must send Stacks tokens (**$STX**) to the CityCoin smart contract on the Stacks Blockchain. Then the official City Treasury can claim 30% of the total $STK that has been staked by the users to mine the City Coin. The first city to have a token launched was Miami. Later on, CityCoin was able to get in contact with the City of Miami, and Miami ended up claiming over $5,000,000 in $STX for their treasury, as announced by the Mayor of Miami.

<div>
  <blockquote className="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m so excited to announce that the <a href="https://twitter.com/CityofMiami?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CityofMiami</a> has received its first-ever disbursement from <a href="https://twitter.com/mineCityCoins?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@mineCityCoins</a> totaling $5.25M. <br/>This is a historic moment for our city to collaborate with an innovative project that creates resources for our city through innovation not taxation.</p>&mdash; Mayor Francis Suarez (@FrancisSuarez) <a href="https://twitter.com/FrancisSuarez/status/1489009285447262211?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charSet="utf-8"></script>
</div>

It is an interesting model. It has succeeded at getting funds into the City of Miami's Treasury. We now need to see how that money will be spent, and how the Miami Coin community will rally behind it. I don't think this particular solution is the be-all-end-all solution for City Coins, but it's a damn good start!

## How Community Currencies Will Positively Impact the World

We've gone through some real Community Currencies that exist right now, but they are all very early experiments! In the next decade Community Currencies are going to have exponential growth. Let's look at 3 examples of systems that will use Community Currencies that have a huge opportunity to change how economics works.

### Circular & Local Economics

We all must adhere to the global economic system, which we know is broken in many places. In the 2020s, reality has slapped us in the face with major supply chain issues. COVID and Russia-Ukraine War have contributed to huge supply chain issues and the most inflation we've seen in +40 years.

**But ANY external crisis could have exacerbated inflation and supply chain issues because the SYSTEM is broken**. The ["Just in Time" delivery of materials](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040215/what-are-main-problems-jit-just-time-production-strategy.asp#:~:text=While%20this%20streamlined%20approach%20can,and%20worsen%20an%20economic%20downturn.) makes the global supply chain extremely fragile. [A ship getting stuck in the Suez Canal had the world worried about the supply chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Suez_Canal_obstruction). Imagine what one single bomb could do to a major trade route like this. These are just examples - there are many more fragile attack points in the global supply chain that we are vulnerable to.

**Community currencies give us an opportunity to build new economies that exist outside of the global economy. Bottom-up, local economies, that more closely resemble how humans interact with each other.** Global economics has brought us some incredible achievements, and I don't think we should abolish it. It's just terrible at _some_ things like global energy production and consumption, wealth distribution, and recycling. Which is why we need Local Economies to exist alongside the global economy!

#### Globalization Sucks for Recycling

Let's use recycling as an example of a system that doesn't work with globalization.

Recycling has an incredible amount of inputs and outputs to the entire system, it is very complex. It depends on many different cohorts of people:

- National, State, and City officials.
- The citizens who are required to follow the recycling guidelines
- The collection of the recycling from the citizens, by individuals who work for the city or a private company hired by the city.
- The companies hired to recycle the material.

Recycling requires millions of tiny decisions made by people every day in order to sort the recycling properly. What we end up with are top-down policy decisions being made, that need to get passed down through the chain of people with responsibilities, and end up influencing millions of tiny decisions.

This is almost impossible to do in a sustainable or regenerative manner. It fails in many different places and results in some pretty bizarre behavior - [where modern countries end up shipping their recycling to poorer countries](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-48444874). On paper, the Country is allowed to write off the material as _recycled_, because the material is an output, being put into a black box of another country, where it will be "recycled". There is then no proof it actually gets recycled, and it is left up to the individual company in the poor country to decide how honest they want to be. Since we live in a global economy that runs on making as much profit as possible, you have to understand that this plastic will often not be recycled. This is also happening because the citizens are not properly recycling the items - and often mix garbage and recycling together. The foriegn company may then decide it is too much effort to unmix it, and they'll just dump it in a landfill.

/>
<div className='caption'>
  Global recycling cannot account for how countries and corporations deal with the material. We  consider the other countries in the system as a black box where it is unknown if the material is truly recycled.
</div>


China used to import a ton of the world’s recycling, and then in 2018, they banned it. This temporarily reduced the global recycling problem, but like a game of wack-a-mole, other countries quickly picked up the slack. So it is hard to blame any single country or corporation. And recycling is just an example of many processes that don't work well on a global scale. textiles, construction, and the automobile industries are bad for it too. We have to blame the crux of the issue, which is the fact that **the global economic machine is a complex system, with many different actors, that no single group can come up with a solution that can be executed in practice.** And therefore, our best bet to fix it is to create a new system.

#### How Local Economies could improve recycling

That new system is a network of Local Economies spread across the world. With advanced open source software, any small community can build out the ledgers, registries, and accounts for their members. And a Community Currency can be used to incentivize the economy to grow fast and under its own control. **The stability will come from communities working together and managing the flow of exchanging goods and services for their currency.**

**Local Economics enables Circular Economies to form and be tested at a small scale.** We can then slowly scale the Local Circular Economies from 1000's of people, to hundreds of thousands, to millions, as long as the technology can scale with efficient communication to match the growing size. Here are some examples of how local economies and Community Currencies could improve recycling for the better:

- A community could incentivize the use of recyclable materials for common items such as coffee cups and takeout containers. For example:
  - All items could be reusable containers like glass.
  - If you show up without a container, you are given a reusable container. You can pay for it to own, or you can earn a "debt" on your account on the community currency ledger. The debt can be repaid if you return the container to a location that accepts returns. If you never repay it, you actually end up paying for the container as the debt token is liqudated and money is pulled from your account.
  - Each restaurant of cafe that adopts this, could be incentivized with the currency as well.
  - This process could work well, as it gets around the chicken and egg problem of having all the restaurants and all the citizens adopt a brand new system. If done correctly, it could work quite quickly.
- The long distance transportation of food involves a lot of waste on packaging and energy spent. Communities could reward grocery stores and restaurants that serve local products within 50km.
  - Local businesses register with the community, whenver a local farmer sells to a local restaurant, both receive a small reward.
  - Residents can track which restaurants serve locally sourced food by examining the ledger of the community currency, through some open source front end.
  - The community could hold an event where each restaurant creates a local dish - a "Local Food Week" (similar to a "Burger Week"). In which restaurants are rewarded for their participation.

These ideas are not particularly well thought out, but what is so powerful is that 100's of communities around the world can be working on similar concepts. Building on top of open source technology means that a city like Miami might lay a lot of ground work for decentralized applications that run with community currencies. Then Minneapolis could come along and copy their dapp completely, or fork it and adjust it as they see fit. Slowly, and then all at once, we will see community currencies adopted in this way.

It is also worth noting that the Circular Economy is not a new concept. Many governments, [especially in the European Union](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/circular-economy-action-plan_en), are trying to implement some aspects of it. Yet no national government today will be able to effectively implement any circular economy, due to the systems and bureaucracy that already exist. It is the combination of open-source blockchain technology and community currencies that gives a blank slate for communities to create their own in Local Economy.

### Startup Cities

Startup Cities are a concept [@balajis](https://twitter.com/balajis) has talked a lot about. Cities and towns now have an incredible opportunity to compete with major cities like New York or London. And Community Currencies will enable fast capital allocation to grow these startup cities. CityDAO, which we talked about early, is one example of a Startup City.

</div>

Historically, the real estate market of a city has acted as a proxy for the city’s success. But with Community Currencies, outside parties can more easily allocate capital, and local citizens can more easily get rewarded for the growth of the city, which they very likely contributed to. This could drive separation between speculation and people owning shelter, which might fix the real estate market in cities like San Francisco, Toronto, and Vancouver. In these cities, it is becoming unaffordable for many citizens to own a home, as speculators drive up prices.

A successful Startup city will use open source technology to clearly represent the allocation of city funds, measure growth, attract new citizens and appease existing citizens. It could innovate by staking the city token - allowing residents to get services for doing so. It could also experiment with inflation to residences the longer they live in the city. There is a lot to explore here.

The success of startup cities will also drive much-needed innovation in traditional cities. A lot of them come to standstill, due to problems like [NIMBYism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY). Cities will have to react, and start treating their citizens as customers, as people become more mobile as remote work becomes more popular.

[Vitalik's "Crypto Cities" blog](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/10/31/cities.html) also gives a wonderful breakdown of how blockchains can enable cities to modernize. He elaborates on how blockchains can simplify and streamline how cities operate, such as: - Land ownership - Business registration - Voting and governance - Identity

A City token can be used to tie into all of the above. And as we can see with the examples, the City could be leveraging their own ERC-20 token, as well as NFTs to represent land ownership and identity.

### Cloud Countries

[Cloud countries are another idea of Balaji's](https://1729.com/how-to-start-a-new-country). It is even more ambitious and futuristic than Startup Cities. But as with most things Balaji writes about, it's incredibly well thought out and is likely to become reality. Here's a quick breakdown of what a Cloud Country can be:

- Grow the community in the digital realm first.
- Rally the community around the idea of a Cloud Country, forming it first digitally, but slowly making a distributed presence in the physical world. The property owned can be distributed through different cities and countries around the world.
- Some of this land could be owned by the Country / DAO that is governing. But people could also join under specific rules with their own land. Someone with a cattle ranch might be able to shop around between different Cloud Countries and decide which one they should join. In one case you might join for protection, or maybe you join for commerce.
- The capital will always be in the cloud, ownership represented on-chain, governance on-chain.

We are likely still far away from seeing a Cloud Country come to fruition. Soon we will get real estate, energy, farming, and waste management onto blockchains and open ledgers. And as this becomes more commonplace, and more communities experiment with currencies, we will see Cloud Countries start to form in a bottom-up, decentralized fashion.

### Decoupling of Assets for Financial Growth and Financial Stability

Local Currencies will allow for the decoupling of assets that exist for financial stability and financial growth. Today most people are forced into their country’s economy, which is attached to the fragile global economy, with its devastating crashes and spectacular rallies. Which ultimately throws people's own livelihoods and security into similar spastic patterns.

There are the basics humans need to survive - food, healthcare, water, shelter, companionship, mobility, and some form of energy to ensure it is possible to harness the basic needs with some redundancy and resilience.

Sadly, over the 20th and the 21st century, across the globe in modern countries, we have traded the management of our own basic survival needs to the global economy to be managed by the state and international corporations. Which has made the livelihoods and security of many people at risk and out of their own control.

All of the basic human needs can be provided in small communities. It is literally our natural habitat. Local Currencies should enable this to be possible. But it will be 1000x better than we had in the hundreds of years ago - because we can actually connect local economies through the internet, and do commerce in a decentralized network of local economies.

For example, a local fishing community could transport fish to a city 100 kilometers inland - in order for that community to provide a service to them - it could be protection, or it is a completely digital service such as a website design, or helping them set up their local currency infrastructure. With open-source tech and community currencies, it is quite easy to do this transaction without holding any fiat currency. As long as there is a way to determine the price of the fish and the digital services in a common currency, such as bitcoin or USD, the two communities can exchange their services directly.

### "Shopifying" the experience of creating Community Currencies

It is great to explain all of the possibilities of what can be built, but we should also go over the open-source tools and technology that will allow this all to be built in a bottom-up manner. Community creating, management, and interactions will become plug-and-play open source technology. What it will look like is a Shopify-like experience for Communities to run on. We can build out distributed and connected local economies, and save countless hours of human productivity. Let's list some categories of "plugins" that already exist.

**Governance**

- Basic voting contracts.
- Quadratic voting and other novel voting contracts are being worked on.
- Multisig wallets.
- DAO Infrastructure.

**Public Registries**

- Business Registries.
- Citizen registries.

**Individuals**

- Decentralized Identities (DIDs).
- Privacy enabled transactions from native privacy coins like ZCash or smart contract-based privacy such as Tornado Cash on Ethereum.

**Tokens, NFTs, and DeFi primitives**

- ERC-20 tokens to satisfy many use cases.
- NFTs to satisfy many use cases.
- Bonding Curves to create algorithmic markets.
- Algorithmic borrowing and lending rates
- Staking contracts - simple staking and dynamic staking.

**Bridging**

- The Cosmos Network has shown rapid growth in its concept of "The Internet of Blockchains". It allows any blockchain to connect through a standard messaging protocol, IBC (The Interblockchain Communication Protocol).
- It isn't well understood yet, but I believe IBC, or something very close to it, will become the standard for blockchain communication. It protects against all the bespoke bridge designs we have seen in 2021 getting hacked. (TODO - link to IBC transactions growth)
- A standard becomes even more important when you consider you will be bridging to small communities. IBC will succeed for the same reason the ERC-20 standard succeeded. An ERC-20 is general and simple enough to work for a multi-billion dollar protocol, and for one single individual to launch their own token with a click of a button.

Therefore we can see IBC being adopted by small communities, and large entities such as cities, who want to streamline their organizations. Having these standards built across the world will create human efficiencies, and save us millions of hours of time.

## Conclusion

Local Circular Economies, Startup Cities and Cloud Countries are bottom-up ecoonomic systems that have a massive opportunity to change how we do business and think about economics. Although there are a lot of problems with the global economic system and fiat currencies, I do not think we should abolish these systems. If we are being relaistic, we are stuck with them for many more decades to come.

These new local economic systems need to go exponentially, and then operate in tandem with the global system. Having both systems provides resilience for the world, as the two systems compliment each other.

The exponential growth of local economic systems will be enabled by open source blockchain technology, particularily Community Currencies. We have open source tools that allow anyone with software development skills to launch Communities from 10 people to over a million, and soon enough it'll be as easy to start a community with this technology, as it is to build an e-commerce business with Shopify. This will lead to a proliferation of local econcomic systems that change the way we do business and economics in the next decade.
