# Community Currencies and Network Currencies
What is most under discussed aspect of blockchains and cryptocurrencies, that have the biggest opportunity to change the global financial system?

Well, that my friends, is Community Currencies.

Community Currencies will change the fundamental operation of our global economy - yet it is largely ignored in the current narrative and conversations of crypto.

Why has it been ignored? Mostly due to incentives - which has driven 99% of people to pay attention to "Network Currencies" (as I call them). We'll get into more details on why Community Currencies are so important, but first let's explain the two types:

- *Network Currency* - A currency that is used by a large, diverse group of individuals or organizations. **It is built to benefit from network effects, and is designed to grow at all costs, as it becomes more useful as more people us it. It will sacrifice stability to obtain growth.**
- *Community Currency* - A currency that is used by a small, well defined group of individuals or organizations. It is built to have a limit to it's size and usage, and once it reaches that limit, it does not have a desire to grow. It will sacrifice growth to obtain stability.

As you can see, they are more or less opposites of each other. 

In the 20th and 21st century, we have been conditioned to only trade, barter and exchange in Network Currencies. This has come about through the modernization of the global economy. Countries took a centralized role in our lives, and completely monopolized the economy for themselves. This ultimately lead to a total dependency on Fiat Currencies (USD, CAD, GBP, etc.) - and eventually to the Global, interconnected economy we have today.

What this means is we have all been forced into economies that fluctuate with instability that is 100% outside of our control. We are going through a particularly instable and turbulent time in the 2020's, which was kicked into high gear by the COVID crisis, and even War. We are likely to see more instability for the next few years.

**I believe cryptocurrencies will also allow Community Currencies to flourish, and have a renaissance of small, Community economies that are resistant to outside, global fluctuations. There will be 1000's of large Community Currencies, and millions of small, or temporary Community Currencies.**

**Although Community Currencies will grow, and provide opportunities for speculation, they will truly shine in their ability to provide stability, and create regenerative, closed loop economies. While Network Currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum compete directly with Fiat currencies for global growth.**

In 5 years, the majority of people will be interacting with Community Currencies and Network Currencies simultaneously. The days where we used to be locked into using a single currency - our own countries Fiat, will be long gone.

Let's describe each in more detail, to paint a deeper picture of what they are.

------

## Network Currencies
Network Currencies are better understood by the general population, so we will be brief.

Fiat Currencies are the best known Network Currencies, so let's discuss the USD, it's benefits and it's problems. Then we will elaborate on Bitcoin and Ethereum

**USD**
- Benefits
  - The USD is the Global Reserve Currency. There are major efficiency benefits here:
    - Countries have a common currency they can settle their debts in and trade in.
    - Countries have a benchmark to compare their own economy and currency to.
    - People travelling to different countries can be confident that bringing USD with them should allow them to transact, or exchange USD for the local currency.
  - Now, here are some benefits of Fiat currencies that relate to all Fiat currencies, not just the global reserve currency:
    - It gives Countries the ability to control their own economy.
- Problems
  - Endless crisis' , to monetary and fiscal policy intervention, to short term recovery, to new crisis.
  - Inflation seems to always come
  - Small group of people deciding how the currency should inflate, which effect millions of people. In the case of the USD, it is billions, due to it being the global reserve currency

**Bitcoin**
- benefits
  - Common global currency to settle in
  - Common Benchmark
  - Anyone around the world with an interent connection can buy it 
  - No intervention
  - The total supply is stuck at 21 million
  - No small group of people has control over it.
- Problems
  - Inflexible. Although this can be a benefit and a problem, depending on the arguement.
  - A big portion of BTC is already in the hands of early adopters, so it is unlikely to ever have a good distribution to the global population.
  - It appears to be a much better store of wealth, rather than an actual currency that people transact in. This is due to the nature of the network


**Ethereum**
- Ethereum is very similar to bitcoin, but it's architecture and community lead to different benefits and problems.
- Benefits
  - Global currency to settle in.
  - Anyone with an internet connection can buy it.
  - More flexible than bitcoin
  - It appears to be money much more so than bitcoin. It is used in DeFi, and is spent a lot. NFTs have brought in a huge global audience of people that hold ETH. It's function as gas on the Ethereum Network has been shown to create a very effective economy. This leads it to being less of a store of value, compared to bitcoin.
- Problems
  - There are small teams that interact with Ethereum, and decide the direction of the cryptocurrecy. It still has the ability to have the vision behind it changed by a small few. 
  - It has plans to evolve into ETH 2 - which is a technology risk.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are in competition with USD and other Fiat currencies. There is room for many Network Currencies, but they are always facing new competitors. There is almost always a strong, cult-like narrative attached to every network currency. They need this to survive and propagate through humans minds.
## Community currencies
Community Currencies are less understood by the general population. They are also pretty new to myself. My in depth research started at [Ethan Buchman's blog](https://ebuchman.github.io), specifically the post [Local Money and Liquidity Saving](https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/local-money-liquidity-saving/). Ethan is one of the founders of [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/), and if you read deeper into his writing you'll see how the Cosmos Technology is the best tech to enable Community Currencies. Ethans blog is also a great segway into more in depth topics and organizations that have been working on Community Currencies, and ideas very similar to it.

A Community Currency is used by a group of defined size, and is used to create a circular economy that promotes spending and economic activity within the group. A Community Currency MAY or MAY NOT look exactly like currency as we understand it today. It could be a City Coin, that functions as a currency that can be used to buy food, or pay for parking. It could also be closer to a reputation that gets you access to an event, or to speak, or to allow strangers to trust you when you enter their community.

Community Currencies have a broad range of possibilities, so I'd like to highlight a bunch of examples to explain better how it works.

### ETH Denver - $SPORK and Food Tokens
[ETH Denver](https://www.ethdenver.com/) is an annual event in February that started in 2018. They [created a community known as SporkDAO](https://medium.com/ethdenver/sporkdao-token-economics-spork-rewards-5d0c1aaa0ba6), explained below:

*SporkDAO has been birthed to complete the evolution of ETHDenver from a wholly owned, centrally controlled entity to a Member-owned digital cooperative. $SPORK is the incentive alignment mechanism that will be used to govern SporkDAO along with being the unit of account for calculating distribution of profits to SporkDAO members should that time come.*

Reading through their plans for $SPORK, it's clear that this is a community currency.

https://medium.com/ethdenver/sporkdao-token-economics-spork-rewards-5d0c1aaa0ba6

$SPORK is a Community Currency that is rewarded to people who have participated in past ETH Denver events. Having $SPORK tokens makes you a member, and membership is open to anyone. They have plans to distribute $SPORK to encourage future membership, and $SPORK will be used to govern the DAO.

During ETH Denver, participants also get Food Tokens. In 2022, these were ERC-20 tokens distributed to participants on the Rinkeby Testnet. These tokens then could be spent at ~15 food trucks outside the venue. Each token represented about $10 USD. The Food Truck owners then got to exchange the tokens for real money with the ETH Denver organizers after the end of the event. The Food Tokens are an example of a **Temporary Community Currency**. It only needed to exist for 4 days, and helped circulate money in an easy way. Becuase of it's temporary, low risk nature, it operated on a testnet, which made every transaction free. **When people talk of millions of Community Currencies being created in the future, they should have the image of Temporary, low risk currencies in their mind.** Although this is a small example, what is so amazing about this is we have created open source technology that allows this to be adopted by any community worldwide. It will continue to get easier to allow this to happen. One day anyone with an internet connection will be able to create a temporary community currency from their phone in a few clicks.

$SPORK might look pretty small right now, and doesn't really trade with any real volume on any decentralized exchange. But this is just the start! $SPORK has a ton of opportunity to be used in the future. Some examples:

- Require ETH Denver sponsors to buy and burn or stake $SPORK.
- Require $SPORK to spend on the food trucks to replace the Food Tokens.
- ETH Denver was oversubscribed and had long lines for non-hackers in 2022. SporkDAO could encourage people to buy and stake $SPORK for fast access.
- SporkDAO could expand to new cities outside of Denver, and use $SPORK to incentivize this growth.

# DAOs and Gaming Clans in the Metaverse
You could claim that a lot of DAOs that exist today are Community Currencies, but I don't think that is very helpful as it is too broad of a description.

A more specific example I like is a DAO, a Gaming Guild or [Gaming Clan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_(video_games)). Gaming Clans have been around for decades, becoming popular by real time strategy games like [StarCraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_(video_game)), among many others.

> TODO IMAGE - video game clan... might need to switch to something else. Leeroy jenkins is much better.

You could imagine a gaming clan with their own internal currency. Which may be in a game like World of Warcraft. But then maybe you could show that currency as you join a new game, and that could give you reputation, or allow you to find past clan members.

These Community Currencies might evolve to enable cross-game reputation.

> TODO - find one short sentence on Gaming Guilds

### Grassroots Economics
[Grassroots Economics](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/pages/about-us.html) is a non-profit foundation that is empowering marginalized communities to be able to take control of their own economic future. They have been around for over a decade, and have boots on the ground in marginalized, rural communities, and have helped them by working closely with them. They have been working on community currencies for a long time, and they have begun to leverage blockchain and open source technology to their benefit. They explain here how they intended to use [blockchain technology](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/open-tech-questions-answers.html). What is so impressive is that they don't treat blockchains as a panacea, they treat the tech as a tool, to help suppliment the hard work they have been doing for over a decade.

  alt="SporkDAO"
  layout="responsive"

  width={900}

https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/pages/sarafu-network.html

They have created the [Sarafu Network](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/pages/sarafu-network.html), which leverages blockchain tech to create local currencies. Sarafu (SRF), is used as a basic income, as well as a bridging token to local communities that create their own Community Inclucsion Currency. In essesnce, you could imagine many small communities making their own currencies which allow for a small local economy. These then bridge up to SRF, which allows them to interact with many nearby local economies. Eventually, as adoption grows, SRF could bridge to a Fiat currency like the Kenyan Shilling. With blockchain technology such as bonding curves, we could have seemless integration of community currencies bridging up to Network Currencies.

This is one of the most exciting projects in Community Currencies.

### Citycoins.co
- **[https://www.citycoins.co/](https://www.citycoins.co/)**
    - **i am almost certain this will be included and I MUST ADD MORE HERE RESEARCH THIS FUCK MORE REEARCH**
    - **it works with STX…. GOOD POINT - i think this is quite key.. BTC IS GOOD**
    - **interestingly…. VERY interestingly, the economic model does not depend on any government support**
    - not necessarily the best design, but its somewhere to start!
- City Coins as speculation on the real estate market seems like an amazing idea
  - Tax breaks as coins too, based on the time you've lived there

### CityDAO - in wyoming
    - Crypto cities will look both like large ranches that band together to protect each other.
    - As well as cheap, portable housing that can create startup cities super fast.

### Technolgy Behind it
- Closed Loop
  - Meaning that exchanging goods, services, and money can be kept within the community
- Stability
  - **Community currency should be resistant to outside policy, effects, decisions, and attacks.**
  - Is it possible that Stablility should not even be expected of a Network currency? Well maybe. Maybe bitcoin is the best we will ever get. But I think you should focus on the stability from within first, rather than relay on stability from the outskirts.
- reciprocity, redistribution, house-holding, exchange (they build on each other in that order)
  - three still found in families, friends, orgs, communities, indiginous tribes,
  - We can see some very early processes playing out in crypto. Airdrops are an example of redistribution. Same with community treasuries. 
- Concepts
  - ragequitting helps with the two way street. but part of the two way street is that the communities joining need to be subject to some fault and risk as well.
  - take 100 of your Community coin. Agree to swap your real world for 500 Community coin in future. thus brining you into the system
    - only way to exit the system, is fees
    - maybe you can use locking mechanisms here
- credit clearing
  - obviously very good at both levels
  - but extremely good and very implementable at Community levels
  - your friends, parents, barber, butcher, grocer, barista, personal trainer, favorite restaurant
    - clearly very bad for tracking taxes (but that is a topic for a different day)
- Will probably cause problems for collecting taxes

## Breaking it up into 4 Categories
To focus further, I believe we should organize cryptocurrencies into 4 categories:

**Decentralized Network Currencies (i.e. Bitcoin, Ether)**
These are in direct competition with Fiat Currencies. A world changing technology that will change global economics.

**Centralized Network Currencies (i.e. Crypto Fintech / Open Wall Street)**
A lot of cryptocurrencies as mascaquarding as Decentralized, yet are far from it, and their core algorithms and designs trend towards more centralization. This has largely been ignored for the bull market of 2020-2021, but will increase in discussion in the next bear market. HOWEVER - one thing that is not talked about is that these cryptos can still lead to successful products. "Crypto Fintech" is an exit from legacy financial systems, into new and improved open techonology that was build as a by-product of excitment in decentralized cryptocurrencies. The first wave of "Fintech" didn't really change much because they have to operate within existing legal frameworks, and they were unable to change the system. Today we have Centralized Network Currencies like $BNB and $FTX. Both of these Centralized exchanges are on paths to become global banks, with global customers. I would bet they both have a market cap larger than every bank in the world within 5 years.
> Note, this is also Fiat 

**Decentralized Community Currencies**
Community Currencies can operate as decentralized. It would allow Community communities to build bridges of trust upwards and downwards to Network Currencies. It is still vague how these bridges will be built and how the trust will be transferred between Community and global communities - but it will be built through a bottom up, trial and error process. Any centralized planning is likely to fail.

**Centralized Community Currencies**
A Centralized Community Currency is a perfectly good use case for open finance technology. There is no harm in having a Proof of Authority (POA) network for a village or city of less than 10,000 people. There are likely societal power dynamics that cannot be replaced by software, and thus there is no reason to build a decentralized system. It is more likely this would work in a system that is meant to mainly focus on trust within the community, rather than a Community Currency that is designed to bridge trust to other communities. The open technology being built will allow for small communities to easily adopt the techonology to build their own system. These are more likely to be small, and even temporary 


I'd like to make a point that the average person only needs to interact with one Community Currency and one Network Currency. There will likely be millions of Community Currencies, and Thousands of Network Currencies. Yet the average person will only need 1 of each. You need both. You need to interact with a Community currency in order to be able to have stability and reliability within your community, and be able to transact with peace of mind. You will want access to a Network Currency for growth potential, but also as a hedge to your own Community Currency failing.

The lines also aren't set in stone. A large enough city could end up having a network currency, and a small enough state could have a Community Currency. These are just guidelines to paint the picture.


## What can Communties do to build with this stuff? i.e. What is so exciting about this stuff? (this seems like a good SOLUTION to the PROBLEMS we have, i.e. end to the blog)
- TODO - Crypto cities vitalik
  - Not only Community coins.... but local Governments too!
    - ownership (land)
    - business registration
    - voting and governance
    - identity
    - GIVE A LINK TO VITALIKS BLOG
  - NOTE - this is where the TOOLS below come in. So fit that in.
- We will give them basic tools to build these currencies in a plug and play manner. Creating a Community currency will be as easy as creating a Shopify Store.
- Tools
  - Cosmos - by nature no buy in. permissionless, not judgemental bridges. bottom up
  - DeFi Primitives
    - Bonding Curves
    - Algo borrow and lending rates
    - Easilt deployable NFTs and ERC20s
    - Staking
  - Governance Primitives
    - Voting, quadratic voting
  - Privacy 
  - Identities
  - Tax collection & accounting.
- These tools will be built, and will be built upon for open source Community organization. 
- Communities will be brought into the digital age with this.
- This will also be adopted by larger entities, like cities, who want to streamline their organizations. Having these stanards built across the world will create for human efficiencies, and save us millions of hours of time.




## Bridging Community and Network Currencies (I MIGHT CUT THIS OUT.... work count, leave to end... but there are entire sentances here that are worth while)
- IBC is likely the best thing to use for this.
- Building a single way for Community currencies to opt upwards into the algo-stablecoin. so that many can do it at once.
- **I think this will be a very important area, which today is completely unexplored, due to there being very little existing Community currencies.**
- Bridging the gap seems like a very big deal because local communities will have economic output, and they will want to exchange their Community output for global assets.
  - Of course they could just exchange it for Bitcoin, and then bridge into the world with that.
  - **but I believe many Community currencies will want some reputation that is recognized by the greater community. their currency will be a way to represent legitimacy**
  - This brings me to a point that Balaji made - that cities will have city coins, which can be used to invest, speculate, and transact within a city. Historically, real estate has been the represetative way to invest in a city and it's growth. Decoupling speculations from home ownership will be a massive win for many global cities around the world. Toronto, where I live, has been victim to foreign speculators buying up condos, and Community investors owning multiple properties and charging rent. 
  - A city with it's own currency has incredible opportunity. Startup cities will become real - where we see small cities take advantage of this and grow. There are also big cities like Miami that seem like they could execute building their own token.
- Community currencies will need to follow some sort of standard. ERC-20 standard is for a basic token. But a Community currency might want to even run its own network of nodes. Cosmos is well positioned to be infrastructure that powers this.
- Once there is a standard for Community Currencies that gains traction, there will be a clear opportunity of how to bridge them to the Network Currencies.

## Conclusion
> Note on fiat to close to fit in nicely - We know the global Fiat system, and monetary governing bodies around the world, are broken. They are lead us from crisis to crisis, with complete inability to stabalilze the economy. Since 2008 this has been evidently clear, and only continue to get worse. Bitcoin has given us a starting point, leading to many decentralized network currencies. And now we will build out Community Currencies to completely change the way we interact. To a way that is more stable, and understandable, for our tiny human brains.

- Community currencies are being ignored for now, but will change the world
  - they dont fix everything, they are not a panacea. but they will change a lot
- Community currencies will aim to be more stable, network currencies aim for growth.
- Community currencies are going to grow. Probably a bit slow. There isn't immediate possibility for it to grow at expoential rates.
- Community currencies enable closed loop and circular ecnomics more easily, and credit clearing
  - this is a way we can fundamentally improve the world economy to look more natural.
- OPEN QUESTION - The bridging between Community and network will be a big opportunity.
- OPEN QUESTIONS maybe to include
  - will they look fundamentally different at different sizes? (NNT)
    - Or can a cosmos chain just be used for netowrk and community currencies
