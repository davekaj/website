# Community Currencies and Network Currencies
What is most under discussed aspect of blockchains and cryptocurrencies, that have the biggest opportunity to change the global financial system?

Well, that my friends, is Community Currencies.

Community Currencies will change the fundamental operation of our global economy - yet it is largely ignored in the current narrative and conversations of crypto.

Why has it been ignored? Mostly due to incentives - which has driven 99% of people to pay attention to "Network Currencies" (as I call them). We'll get into more details on why Community Currencies are so important, but first let's explain the two types:

- *Network Currency* - A currency that is used by a large, diverse group of individuals or organizations. **It is built to benefit from network effects, and is designed to grow at all costs, as it becomes more useful as more people us it. It will sacrifice stability to obtain growth.**
- *Community Currency* - A currency that is used by a small, well defined group of individuals or organizations. It is built to have a limit to it's size and usage, and once it reaches that limit, it does not have a desire to grow. It will sacrifice growth to obtain stability.

As you can see, they are more or less opposites of each other. 

In the 20th and 21st century, we have been conditioned to only trade, barter and exchange in Network Currencies. This has come about through the modernization of the global economy. Countries took a centralized role in our lives, and completely monopolized the economy for themselves. This ultimately lead to a total dependency on Fiat Currencies (USD, CAD, GBP, etc.) - and eventually to the Global, interconnected economy we have today.

What this means is we have all been forced into economies that fluctuate with instability that is 100% outside of our control. We are going through a particularly instable and turbulent time in the 2020's, which was kicked into high gear by the COVID crisis, and even War. We are likely to see more instability for the next few years.

**I believe cryptocurrencies will also allow Community Currencies to flourish, and have a renaissance of small, Community economies that are resistant to outside, global fluctuations. There will be 1000's of large Community Currencies, and millions of small, or temporary Community Currencies.**

**Although Community Currencies will grow, and provide opportunities for speculation, they will truly shine in their ability to provide stability, and create regenerative, closed loop economies. While Network Currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum compete directly with Fiat currencies for global growth.**

In 5 years, the majority of people will be interacting with Community Currencies and Network Currencies simultaneously. The days where we used to be locked into using a single currency - our own countries Fiat, will be long gone.

Let's describe each in more detail, to paint a deeper picture of what they are.

------

## Network Currencies
Network Currencies are better understood by the general population, so we will be brief.

Fiat Currencies are the best known Network Currencies, so let's discuss the USD, it's benefits and it's problems. Then we will elaborate on Bitcoin and Ethereum

**USD**
- Benefits
  - The USD is the Global Reserve Currency. There are major efficiency benefits here:
    - Countries have a common currency they can settle their debts in and trade in.
    - Countries have a benchmark to compare their own economy and currency to.
    - People travelling to different countries can be confident that bringing USD with them should allow them to transact, or exchange USD for the local currency.
  - Now, here are some benefits of Fiat currencies that relate to all Fiat currencies, not just the global reserve currency:
    - It gives Countries the ability to control their own economy.
- Problems
  - Endless crisis' , to monetary and fiscal policy intervention, to short term recovery, to new crisis.
  - Inflation seems to always come
  - Small group of people deciding how the currency should inflate, which effect millions of people. In the case of the USD, it is billions, due to it being the global reserve currency

**Bitcoin**
- benefits
  - Common global currency to settle in
  - Common Benchmark
  - Anyone around the world with an interent connection can buy it 
  - No intervention
  - The total supply is stuck at 21 million
  - No small group of people has control over it.
- Problems
  - Inflexible. Although this can be a benefit and a problem, depending on the arguement.
  - A big portion of BTC is already in the hands of early adopters, so it is unlikely to ever have a good distribution to the global population.
  - It appears to be a much better store of wealth, rather than an actual currency that people transact in. This is due to the nature of the network


**Ethereum**
- Ethereum is very similar to bitcoin, but it's architecture and community lead to different benefits and problems.
- Benefits
  - Global currency to settle in.
  - Anyone with an internet connection can buy it.
  - More flexible than bitcoin
  - It appears to be money much more so than bitcoin. It is used in DeFi, and is spent a lot. NFTs have brought in a huge global audience of people that hold ETH. It's function as gas on the Ethereum Network has been shown to create a very effective economy. This leads it to being less of a store of value, compared to bitcoin.
- Problems
  - There are small teams that interact with Ethereum, and decide the direction of the cryptocurrecy. It still has the ability to have the vision behind it changed by a small few. 
  - It has plans to evolve into ETH 2 - which is a technology risk.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are in competition with USD and other Fiat currencies. There is room for many Network Currencies, but they are always facing new competitors. There is almost always a strong, cult-like narrative attached to every network currency. They need this to survive and propagate through humans minds.
## Community currencies
Community Currencies are less understood by the general population. They are also pretty new to myself. My in depth research started at [Ethan Buchman's blog](https://ebuchman.github.io), specifically the post [Local Money and Liquidity Saving](https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/local-money-liquidity-saving/). Ethan is one of the founders of [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/), and if you read deeper into his writing you'll see how the Cosmos Technology is the best tech to enable Community Currencies. Ethans blog is also a great segway into more in depth topics and organizations that have been working on Community Currencies, and ideas very similar to it.

A Community Currency is used by a group of defined size, and is used to create a circular economy that promotes spending and economic activity within the group. A Community Currency MAY or MAY NOT look exactly like currency as we understand it today. It could be a City Coin, that functions as a currency that can be used to buy food, or pay for parking. It could also be closer to a reputation that gets you access to an event, or to speak, or to allow strangers to trust you when you enter their community.

Community Currencies have a broad range of possibilities, so I'd like to highlight a bunch of examples to explain better how it works.

### ETH Denver - $SPORK and Food Tokens
[ETH Denver](https://www.ethdenver.com/) is an annual event in February that started in 2018. They [created a community known as SporkDAO](https://medium.com/ethdenver/sporkdao-token-economics-spork-rewards-5d0c1aaa0ba6), explained below:

*SporkDAO has been birthed to complete the evolution of ETHDenver from a wholly owned, centrally controlled entity to a Member-owned digital cooperative. $SPORK is the incentive alignment mechanism that will be used to govern SporkDAO along with being the unit of account for calculating distribution of profits to SporkDAO members should that time come.*

Reading through their plans for $SPORK, it's clear that this is a community currency.

https://medium.com/ethdenver/sporkdao-token-economics-spork-rewards-5d0c1aaa0ba6

$SPORK is a Community Currency that is rewarded to people who have participated in past ETH Denver events. Having $SPORK tokens makes you a member, and membership is open to anyone. They have plans to distribute $SPORK to encourage future membership, and $SPORK will be used to govern the DAO.

During ETH Denver, participants also get Food Tokens. In 2022, these were ERC-20 tokens distributed to participants on the Rinkeby Testnet. These tokens then could be spent at ~15 food trucks outside the venue. Each token represented about $10 USD. The Food Truck owners then got to exchange the tokens for real money with the ETH Denver organizers after the end of the event. The Food Tokens are an example of a **Temporary Community Currency**. It only needed to exist for 4 days, and helped circulate money in an easy way. Becuase of it's temporary, low risk nature, it operated on a testnet, which made every transaction free. **When people talk of millions of Community Currencies being created in the future, they should have the image of Temporary, low risk currencies in their mind.** Although this is a small example, what is so amazing about this is we have created open source technology that allows this to be adopted by any community worldwide. It will continue to get easier to allow this to happen. One day anyone with an internet connection will be able to create a temporary community currency from their phone in a few clicks.

$SPORK might look pretty small right now, and doesn't really trade with any real volume on any decentralized exchange. But this is just the start! $SPORK has a ton of opportunity to be used in the future. Some examples:

- Require ETH Denver sponsors to buy and burn or stake $SPORK.
- Require $SPORK to spend on the food trucks to replace the Food Tokens.
- ETH Denver was oversubscribed and had long lines for non-hackers in 2022. SporkDAO could encourage people to buy and stake $SPORK for fast access.
- SporkDAO could expand to new cities outside of Denver, and use $SPORK to incentivize this growth.

# DAOs and Gaming Clans in the Metaverse
You could claim that a lot of DAOs that exist today are Community Currencies, but I don't think that is very helpful as it is too broad of a description.

A more specific example I like is a DAO, a Gaming Guild or [Gaming Clan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_(video_games)). Gaming Clans have been around for decades, becoming popular by real time strategy games like [StarCraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_(video_game)), among many others.

> TODO IMAGE - video game clan... might need to switch to something else. Leeroy jenkins is much better.

You could imagine a gaming clan with their own internal currency. Which may be in a game like World of Warcraft. But then maybe you could show that currency as you join a new game, and that could give you reputation, or allow you to find past clan members.

These Community Currencies might evolve to enable cross-game reputation.

> TODO - find one short sentence on Gaming Guilds

### Grassroots Economics
[Grassroots Economics](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/pages/about-us.html) is a non-profit foundation that is empowering marginalized communities to be able to take control of their own economic future. They have been around for over a decade, and have boots on the ground in marginalized, rural communities, and have helped them by working closely with them. They have been working on community currencies for a long time, and they have begun to leverage blockchain and open source technology to their benefit. They explain here how they intended to use [blockchain technology](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/open-tech-questions-answers.html). What is so impressive is that they don't treat blockchains as a panacea, they treat the tech as a tool, to help suppliment the hard work they have been doing for over a decade. 

<Image
  src="/images/community-currencies/sarafu.png"
  alt="SporkDAO"
  layout="responsive"
  height={300}
  width={900}
/>
https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/pages/sarafu-network.html

They have created the [Sarafu Network](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/pages/sarafu-network.html), which leverages blockchain tech to create local currencies. Sarafu (SRF), is used as a basic income, as well as a bridging token to local communities that create their own Community Inclucsion Currency. In essesnce, you could imagine many small communities making their own currencies which allow for a small local economy. These then bridge up to SRF, which allows them to interact with many nearby local economies. Eventually, as adoption grows, SRF could bridge to a Fiat currency like the Kenyan Shilling. With blockchain technology such as bonding curves, we could have seemless integration of community currencies bridging up to Network Currencies.

This is one of the most exciting projects in Community Currencies.

### CityDAO and CityCoins
Cities having their own coins are concievably the largest physical-space Community Currency that can exist. A City has a defined land barrier that is accessible by car to any resident.

For a great primer on the potential for City Coins, checkout @balajis's tweet thread:

https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1400706913742905345
TODO - Embedd the tweet into the blog

There are a lot of opportunities described in that thread. And there are 2 companies working on two of those opportunities right now.

[CityDAO](https://www.citydao.io/) is a project that is exploring on-chain land ownership. They begun by buying a parcel of land in Wyoming, and auctioning off the NFT. The DAO is managed by the community, and Wyoming was chosen as it created a law in 2021 that recognizes DAOs legal entities. **This is a city from scratch approach. Completely avoiding the burocracy and resistance in an existing city, that will slow down the adoption of technology.** It is an audacious goal, and they are working on it step by step as they are the first to try it. But I 100% believe we will see successful cities built in the next 20 years through this process. [REF]

[Citycoins](https://www.citycoins.co/) is a project that creates a token for a city. They use an interesting approach - there is no approval needed by the city to partner with CityCoins. They allow for a grassroots movement of citizens and/or speculators to mine the token. In order to mine the token, they must send Stacks tokens ($STX) to the CityCoin smart contract on the Stacks Blockchain. Then the official City Treasury can claim 30% of the total $STK that has been staked on the city. The first city to launch have a token is Miami. CityCoin was able to get in contact with the Miami, and ultimately Miami has claimed over $5,000,000 in $STX for their treasury, as [announced by the Mayor of Miami](https://twitter.com/FrancisSuarez/status/1489009285447262211).

TODO - embed the tweet

It is an interesting model. Clearly it has succeeded in getting funds into the City of Miami. We need to see now how the feedback loop of that money, and the Miami Coin community, result in spending the money productively. I don't think it is the be-all-end-all solution for City Coins, but it's a damn good start.

## Breaking it up into 4 Categories
To focus further, I believe we should organize cryptocurrencies into 4 categories:

**Decentralized Network Currencies (i.e. Bitcoin, Ether)**
These are in direct competition with Fiat Currencies. A world changing technology that will change global economics.

**Centralized Network Currencies (i.e. Crypto Fintech / Open Wall Street)**
A lot of cryptocurrencies as mascaquarding as Decentralized, yet are far from it, and their core algorithms and designs trend towards more centralization. This has largely been ignored for the bull market of 2020-2021, but will increase in discussion in the next bear market. HOWEVER - one thing that is not talked about is that these cryptos can still lead to successful products. "Crypto Fintech" is an exit from legacy financial systems, into new and improved open techonology that was build as a by-product of excitment in decentralized cryptocurrencies. The first wave of "Fintech" didn't really change much because they have to operate within existing legal frameworks, and they were unable to change the system. Today we have Centralized Network Currencies like $BNB and $FTX. Both of these Centralized exchanges are on paths to become global banks, with global customers. I would bet they both have a market cap larger than every bank in the world within 5 years.
> Note, this is also Fiat 

**Decentralized Community Currencies**
Community Currencies can operate as decentralized. It would allow Community communities to build bridges of trust upwards and downwards to Network Currencies. It is still vague how these bridges will be built and how the trust will be transferred between Community and global communities - but it will be built through a bottom up, trial and error process. Any centralized planning is likely to fail.

**Centralized Community Currencies**
A Centralized Community Currency is a perfectly good use case for open finance technology. There is no harm in having a Proof of Authority (POA) network for a village or city of less than 10,000 people. There are likely societal power dynamics that cannot be replaced by software, and thus there is no reason to build a decentralized system. It is more likely this would work in a system that is meant to mainly focus on trust within the community, rather than a Community Currency that is designed to bridge trust to other communities. The open technology being built will allow for small communities to easily adopt the techonology to build their own system. These are more likely to be small, and even temporary 


I'd like to make a point that the average person only needs to interact with one Community Currency and one Network Currency. There will likely be millions of Community Currencies, and Thousands of Network Currencies. Yet the average person will only need 1 of each. You need both. You need to interact with a Community currency in order to be able to have stability and reliability within your community, and be able to transact with peace of mind. You will want access to a Network Currency for growth potential, but also as a hedge to your own Community Currency failing.

The lines also aren't set in stone. A large enough city could end up having a network currency, and a small enough state could have a Community Currency. These are just guidelines to paint the picture.


## Okay , what is so special about Community Currencies?
### New Type of Economics
We live in a global economic system. The system is far from perfect. In the 2020's, reality has slapped us in the face with supply chain issues. COVID and War have brought the supply chain issues to their current levels - but it could have been any crisis that created a supply chain issue. The problem is that the system is broken.

**Community currencies give us an opportunity to build out a new type of economic system. Bottom-up, local economies, that are closer to the realties of how humans interact with the physical world, as well as with each other.** Global economics has brought us some incredible acheivement, and I don't think we should abolish it. It's just terrible at some things. For example, globalization is good for making complex product that need rare earth metals, like a Tesla Model 3. Local economics could never achieve that.

But Globalalization is terrible for Recycling:
- Passing laws on Recyclying from a National or a State level is so far seperated from an individual recycling an item, that it is extremely hard to enforce properly.
- When it is hard to enforce, very simple, high level decisions need to be made as to what suffices for recyling.

This results in some pretty bizarre behaviour - [where modern countries end up shipping their recycling to poorer countries](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-48444874). On paper, the Country is allowed to write off the material as *recycled*, because the material is an output, being put into a black box of another country, where it will be "recycled". There is then no proof it acutally gets recycled, and it is left up to the individual company in the poor country to decide how honest they want to be. Since we live in a global economy that runs on making as much profit as possible, you have to understand that this plastic will often not be recycled.

> TODO - Create an image for the recycling 


Not to mention, the lifecycle of the material. Let's think of the jounrey from raw material to poor country:
- Mine the raw material from different countries around to world.
- Ship materials to the manufacturer in the modern country
- Produce the plastic products (while using energy, almost always some type of oil is burned)
- Ship these products around to citizens of the country for consumption
- Citizens dump into their garbage or recycling bin (the West is bad for this. Japan is much better, but still not perfect).
- It gets gathered by the local city employees.
- Then we throw it on shipping containers and ship it to a poorer country (using a ton of diesel fule to transport it).
- Then the poorer citizens work to sort it and recycle it for real, or the owner of the company just dumps it, to sace money.

> TODO - This could be an image too

It's hard to blame anyone here. It's the global economic system. China used to import a ton of the worlds recyclying, and then in 2018 they banned it. Temporarily, this decreased national exports. But like a game of wack-a-mole, other countries quickly picked up the slack.

I don't believe any meaningful recycling or regeneration can be done from a global, top down system.

The only way is to scale a system to be regenerative, at the limits of what our current technology will allow us to achieve for it to still be a local, or community effort. The community has to govern itself, set it's own rules, and realize it's own success within their own community. 

The recycling is just an example of many processes that don't work well on a global scale. And it can be fixed - since with Community Currencies we can create systems from scratch, and having a blank slate is a very powerful tool.

Recyling is just one of many systems that is better solved by a Local Economy. In a Local Economy, there are some concepts worth pointing out (LINK TO ETHAN):
> TODO - read ethans blog to solidify these again

- Closed Loop Systems -  Meaning that exchanging goods, services, and money can be kept within the community
- Stability -  **Community currency should be resistant to outside policy, effects, decisions, and attacks.**
- reciprocity, redistribution, house-holding, exchange (they build on each other in that order)
  - three still found in families, friends, orgs, communities, indiginous tribes,
  - We can see some very early processes playing out in crypto. Airdrops are an example of redistribution. Same with community treasuries. 

### Startup Cities & Cloud Countries
Startup Cities are a concept [@balajis](https://twitter.com/balajis) has talked a lot about. Cities and towns now have an incredible opportunity to compete with major cities around the world like New York or London. And Community Currencies will enable incredible capital allocation to get fast moving cities to grow.

Historically, the real estate market of a city has acted as a proxy for the cities success. But with Community Currencies, outside parties can more easily allocate capital, and local citizens can more easily get rewarded for the growth of the city, which they very likely contributed to.

A successful Startup city will use open source techonology to clearly represent the allocation of city funds, measure growth, attract new citizens and appease existing citizens. It could enable staking of the city token for citizens to get benefits. It could allocate city tokens to residence every year. 

The success of startup cities will also drive much needed innovation in tradional cities. A lot of them come to standstills, due to problems like [NIMBYism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY). They will have to react, and start treating their citizens like customers.

[Vitalik's "Crypto Cities"](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/10/31/cities.html) blog also gives a wonderful breakdown of the potential of how blockchains can enable cities to modernize. He elaborates on how blockchains can simplfy and streamline how cities operate, such as:
    - Land ownership
    - Business registration
    - Voting and governance
    - Identity

A City token can be used to tie into all of the above, but obivously we would be leveraging blockchains for NFTs, voting contracts, businesses registries, etc.

[Cloud countries are another idea of Balaji's](https://1729.com/how-to-start-a-new-country).

- Growth the community in the digital realm first.
- Rally the community around the idea of a cloud country, forming it first digitally, but slowly making a distributed presense in the physical world.
- It can actually begin with private homes or condos. Then someone purchases a large acerage of land, where people can congregate. Soon, maybe someone buys a ranch.
- Some of this land could be owned by the Country / DAO that is governing. But people could also join under specific rules with their own land - and potentially shop around for different countries to join. In one case you might join for protection, or maybe you join for commerce. A Cloud country might only need 1 cattle ranch, or 1 corn farm, and might even fight to get a farmer to join the DAO.
- The capital will always be in the cloud, ownership represented on chain, governance on chain. The pieces of land that are owned are 

We are likely still farm away from this - but we will start doing physical commerce in the cloud - like farming, property, energy, water and waste management. Slowly, this will build up, in a bottom up process as well.

### Decoupling of Financial Growth and Financial Stability
Local Currencies will make the decoupling of assets for financial stability and financial growth. Right now most people are forced into their countries economy. The global economy is fragile and goes through whipsaws of crashes and rallies in the stock market and real estate market, and it throws people's own livlihoods and security into similar patterns. 

There are the basics humans need to survive - food, healthcare, water, shelter, companionship, mobility, and some form of energy to ensure it is possible to harness all of these, with some redundancy / resilience.

Sadly, all of these are tied directly to the global economy. Over the 20th and the 21st century, across the globe in modern countries, we have traded the management of our own basic survival needs to the global economy - in the form of the state, corporations, and sometimes even international corporations. Which has made the livelihoods and secuirty of many people at risk. 

All of the basic human needs can be provided in small communities. It is literally our natural habitat. Local Currencies should enable this to be possible. But it will be 1000x better than we had in the hundreds of years ago - because we can actually connect local economies through the internet, and do commerce in a decentralized network of local economies.

For example, a local fishing community could transport fish to a city 100 kilometers inland - in order for that communtiy to provide a service to them - it could be protection, or it could even be the management of the fishing communities website, or local currency, a completely digital service. With open source tech and community currencies it is quite easy to do to this transaction with Fiat, or even Bitcoin. As long as there is a way to determine the price of the fish and the digital services in a common currency, such as bitcoin or USD, the two communities can exchange their services directly.

### The Shopify for Community Currencies - Open Source Technology and Tools enabling it all
It is great to explain all of the possbilities fo what can be built, but we should also go over the tools that will allow this all to be built in a bottom up manner. Community creating, management, and interactions will become plug-and-play open source technology. What it will look like is a Shopfiy like expereince for Communities to run on. We can rebuilt the entire way we the economy works, and save countless hours of human productivity. Let's list some categories of "plugins" that already exist.

**Governance**
- Basic voting contracts.
- Quadratic voting, and other novel voting contracts being worked on.
- Multisig wallets.
- DAO Infrastructure - many projects have been funded on this.

**Public Registries**
- Business Registries

**Individuals**
- Decentralized Identities (DIDs).
- Privacy enabled transactions (Tornado Cash) as well as some new protocols working on private transactions.

**Tokens, NFTs, and DeFi primitives**
- ERC-20 tokens to satisfy many use cases.
- NFTs to satisfy many use cases.
- Bonding Curves to create algorithmic markets.
- Algorithmic borrowing and lending rates
- Staking contracts - simple staking, or long term, dynamic staking.

**Bridging**
- The Cosmos Network has shown rapid growth it their concept of "The Internet of Blockchains". It naturally allows any blockchains to connect to each other, through a standard messaging protcol, IBC (The Interblockchain Communication Protocol). (TODO - link to IBC txs growth)
- It isn't well understood yet, but I believe IBC, or something very close to it, will become the standard for blockchain communication. It protects against all the bespoke bridge designs we have seen in 2021 getting hacked. (LINK?). 
- A standard becomes even more important when you consider you will be briding on small communities, of maybe only 1000 people. IBC will succeed for the same reason the ERC-20 standard succeeded. An ERC-20 is general enough to work for a multi-billion dollar protocol, and for one single individual to launch their own token with a click of a button. 
- As we have an internet of blockchains and a web of trust across these communities and networks, a standard will make it easy to communicate in a similar language, from different cultures and communities around the world.


All of the above existing today, and there is still stuff I have left out, and there will be stuff built in the future that make an impact too.

This will also be adopted by larger entities, like cities, who want to streamline their organizations. Having these stanards built across the world will create for human efficiencies, and save us millions of hours of time.

## Conclusion
> Note on fiat to close to fit in nicely - We know the global Fiat system, and monetary governing bodies around the world, are broken. They are lead us from crisis to crisis, with complete inability to stabalilze the economy. Since 2008 this has been evidently clear, and only continue to get worse. Bitcoin has given us a starting point, leading to many decentralized network currencies. And now we will build out Community Currencies to completely change the way we interact. To a way that is more stable, and understandable, for our tiny human brains.

- Community currencies are being ignored for now, but will change the world
  - they dont fix everything, they are not a panacea. but they will change a lot
- Community currencies will aim to be more stable, network currencies aim for growth.
- Community currencies are going to grow. Probably a bit slow. There isn't immediate possibility for it to grow at expoential rates.
- Community currencies enable closed loop and circular ecnomics more easily, and credit clearing
  - this is a way we can fundamentally improve the world economy to look more natural.
- OPEN QUESTION - The bridging between Community and network will be a big opportunity.
- OPEN QUESTIONS maybe to include
  - will they look fundamentally different at different sizes? (NNT)
    - Or can a cosmos chain just be used for netowrk and community currencies
