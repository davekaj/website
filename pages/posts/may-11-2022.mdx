Today is the day $LUNA and $UST blew up, spectacularly.

On days like today, reality gets shattered. 99% of people did not see this coming. There is an important distinction here. Many people did claim to see a death spiral for $UST coming. But predicting when and how it will happen, was next to impossible.

Determining the how comes down to seconds. Some people bought $LUNA at $0.60 and sold it one hour later for $3.00. Having the confidence to make that trade means you knew exactly what was happening. Otherwise, most people were just gambling.

Day’s like today your brain can run into overdrive. It is constantly thinking, comparing, panicking, and questioning, with no ability to turn off. Twitter is simultaneously exciting and terrifying. Like a trainwreck, you can’t look away.

## Max Pain

$LUNA imploded.
This day ranks up there with March 12, 2020, when COVID crashed the market. I wasn’t around for Mt. Gox or The DAO, so I can’t compare to those. But this is Max Pain.

Max Pain days are always different and you will know when you are experiencing it. Your reality shifts before your eyes. You will know it’s a Max Pain day because everyone else feels the same way. And the day becomes galvanized in the collective consciousness of crypto.

## Death Spiral

In short, $LUNA went into a death spiral because $LUNA is the only thing backing up $18 billion dollars of $UST.

An attacker initiated the attack, and then the death spiral took over and drove down the $LUNA price from $60 to $0.90 in under 48 hours.
Put even simpler, $LUNA was a Ponzi scheme.

## Why did this happen?

- Humans naturally create bubbles. $LUNA going up in price and $UST going up in issuance, give validity to the idea and the protocol. If the number goes up, it must be a good coin. The collective confidence around $LUNA was bizarre. So many very smart people got sucked into the vortex of price go up. I myself became less and less skeptical of it the larger it grew, up until it got into the top 10, at which point I was reminded it felt “too good to be true”.
- The confidence in the founder of $LUNA, Do Kwon, was off the charts. It drew in a lot of people to the ecosystem both for belief and criticism. His style brought a lot of growth to the ecosystem, but it also puts a target on $LUNAs back.
- Obviously, a Ponzi is unsustainable.
- There were many people that warned about the problems with UST and that this death spiral would occur. I didn't feel this way, I never had the time to look into Terra deeply. But I never bought any. Mainly because Anchor’s 20% APY felt “Too Good To Be True”. There is a reason it is a cliche.
- Oddly enough, thinking back to 2021, I remember that you could get 20% APY on Convex easily, and even get 8-9% APY on Aave or Compound. At these times, Terra was quite young, and Anchor didn’t seem so ridiculous. But like a frog in hot water, it seems Terra kept the gas on the pedal until the water started to boil.
- Reflecting on the marketing as well - I was never digging deep into Terra because I didn’t hold any. But I kind of bought the idea of the LFG buying $10 billion in BTC to back up $UST. It seemed like it could work. And lots of big VCs were behind it. Surely they weren’t dumb! The lesson here is Do Your Own Research. You will never get the full story unless you verify it yourself. Especially in crypto, where everyone pumps their own bags.

## What can we learn from this?

- It seems the most popular founders always fall. The faster they lift you up, the faster they’ll drag you down.
- A BIG problem with DeFi, especially algo-stable coins - is their transparency. This is great for censorship resistance, but it is a very weak point to fend off attackers. Whoever attacked Terra, had about 80% of the information they needed, and were probably 99% confident they could pull it off. $LUNA's best defense on the first day of the attack was that they had closed-door meetings to try to raise funds to defend the peg. This kept attackers at bay. If $LUNA was truly, fully decentralized, it would have been crystal clear how to pull off the attack. The ironic part is that the only thing that gave $LUNA a chance was a group of rich people making a centralized decision to defend the peg or not.
- In a bull market, Maker gets made fun of by up-and-coming DeFi projects for being slow, and too safe. On days like today, they are praised.
- Stablecoins that are over collateralized, like DAI, LUSD, and MIM have held up well. I always considered $UST to be the weakest of all the stablecoins. And if you are going to panic, panic early. Now that $UST has broken, I’d exit the next riskiest, which is likely $MIM.
- Do Kwon made a lot of jabs at people on Twitter on his way up to success. As of today, most of these tweets did not age well. It might be tempting to throw punches on your way up, or at someone on their way down. But it almost always backfires.
- And It works both ways. People took jabs at Do when $LUNA was $30 yesterday and it was pretty funny! But today at $0.90 the whole situation is just sad and depressing for so many people.
- I think $LUNA should be held to a high standard, and also criticized for what they did and how they did it. We need to improve and we all must learn from it. But, timing is important. And there is no honor in kicking someone when they are down.

## Looking to the future for DeFi

Well, we are likely to have many more Ponzi's, but each will look slightly different. We are human, and I believe it is part of our nature. But I do believe each time we are getting stronger, and learning from our mistakes. I am actually surprised how well BTC and ETH held up in a -99% crash for $LUNA.

Eventually, we will have an incredibly distributed, redundant, and safe DeFi economy. It’s going to be very hard to get there though. There was a rumor Citidel or BlackRock started the attack on Luna. At this point, they seem to have denied it. But if they are not here yet, they are coming right away. Crypto is going to grow. We all know it. We now have their attention.

There will be incoming attacks from regulators and hedge funds. The attacks will be sophisticated - coming with billions of dollars of capital, and decades of experience in financial markets. Not to mention, attacks from black hat hackers, and rival blockchains. I think the golden age of crypto is over. And by that - I think the easy money is done.

Days like today shove reality in your face. And here is my new reality:

- Crypto is here to stay. And it is now globally accepted.
- Now that this is globally accepted, the competition is going to ramp up exponentially.
- The competition will heat up and capital will dry up. Lots of crypto startups will fold - similar to the dot com crash. There is just too much crap out there. If something like $LUNA can blow up, the vapourware out there doesn’t stand a chance.
- I think we experienced Max Pain in the crypto markets, but we going to see something break in the traditional markets before the Fed pulls back.
- It’s best now to get into a defensive position. Build for the future.
- **We need to stop financializing eveyrthing in crypto and try to come up with new economic systems and constructions. From 2020-2022 we basically built a "Mini-Wall Street" on the blockchain**.
- The memes are the best in the bera market, so that is something to look forward to!

Eventually, the crypto native will prevail. Because we are young and agile and full of exciting new ideas. The old guard is losing power and getting old. Biden is turning 80 this year. He represents the boomer's last stand at hanging onto their power.
