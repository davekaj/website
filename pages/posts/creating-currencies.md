# Local Currencies and Network Currencies (Still a Draft)

(TODO - better intro sentence)

Local Currencies will change the way the world economy functions at its core - yet it is still mostly unexplored. 

Local Currencies are an underdeveloped field in the cryptocurrency space that I believe will have more significance over the next 5 years. Most of the development in cryptocurrencies we have seen are around "Network Currencies". Let us describe the two types of currencies:

- Network Currency - A currency that is used by a large, diverse group of individuals or organizations. It is built to benefit from network effects, and wants to grow at scale, as it becomes more useful as more people us it. It will sacrifice stability to obtain growth.
- Local Currency - A currency that is used by a small, well defined group of individuals or organizations. It is built to a defined limit, and once it reaches that limit, it does not have a desire to grow. It will sacrifice growth to obtain stability.

As you can see, they are designed to be complete opposites of each other. 

In the 20th and 21st century, we have been conditioned to only trade, barter and exchange in Network Currencies. This has come about through the modernization of the global economy, countries taking a more centralized and more significant role in our lives, ultimately leading to a total dependency on Fiat Currencies (USD, CAD, GBP, etc.).

What this means is we have all been forced into economies that fluctuate with instability that is 100% outside of our control. We are going through a particularly instable and turbulent time in the 2020's, which was kicked into high gear by the COVID crisis. We are going to see more instability in the coming years, and it won't be pretty.

We need both stability and growth in life and the economy. I will make a point here - that we should split up these two desire in economics into the two different currencies. Of course you can have some growth within a Local Currency, and some stability in a Network Currency, but I believe Local should optimize for stability, and Network for growth.

## You'll need 1 of each
- But most of us have been forced into a single network currency for many decades.
- You'll always want to consistently exit a system that you are not a part of, or not well represented in.
- Especially if we can make an infinite amount of economies, tokens, monies, etc. 
- We often think of money and currencies in a finite design space. Countries (which control violence, and before that empires, states, the church, etc.) determine currency. We also have commodities, and other rare metals that can be treated as currency. 
  - But now the design space is wide open.
- **So I think we will opt into large currencies yes. But we also need to opt into local currencies that are so close to what we are doing, that decisions we make directly effect us and the people we interact with on a daily basis. This currency might very well be for the physical world, or the digital world.**

We should also split up examples where you would expect to use a Local Currency and a Network Currency:

**Local Currency**
- Immediate Family and Friends.
- Your local neighbourhood.
- Your town or city.
- A city or town that you visit. Likely you can use a Network Currency to transact there, but you might pay an extra fee. If you stay long enough, you might want to opt into their system, if they allow it.
- A clan or DAO currency in the Metaverse. (Local Currency will exist in physical space, as well as digital).


**Network Currency**
- State
- Country
- Global. Although there are a lot of problems with Fiat currency, there are some good things. Having the USD as the global reserve currency removes a lot of friction to international trade. Everyone can benchmark against the USD, and it creates a global story we can all follow and organize around. Having similar features in cryptocurrencies is highly desirable. There are a lot of transactions you will do that need to use a Network Currency, and the person you are interacting with will have never heard of your favorite Local Currency.

I'd like to make a point that the average person only needs to interact with one Local Currency and one Network Currency. There will likely be millions of Local Currencies, and Thousands of Network Currencies. Yet the average person will only need 1 of each. You need both. You need to interact with a Local currency in order to be able to have stability and reliability within your community, and be able to transact with peace of mind. You will want access to a Network Currency for growth potential, but also as a hedge to your own Local Currency failing.

The lines also aren't set in stone. A large enough city could end up having a network currency, and a small enough state could have a Local Currency. These are just guidelines to paint the picture.

The point I want to get across in this blog is that we will need both Local and Network Currencies, and that blockchains are going to facilitate this. I believe the Local Currencies are more important to build, foster, and champion because we already have Network Currencies being worked on - pretty much every blockchain that is well known is a Network Currency.

Let's dig into the Network Currency landscape today.
## Network Currencies
Much has been written about Fiat Currencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum. So I will only briefly touch on these topics. One point to take away about the network currencies is that they are competing with each other directly. For example:

- USD is the global reserve currency. All other currencies compete with it in some way. The only other Fiat currency that is competing to be a global reserve currency today is the Chinese Yuan.
- Bitcoin is competing with all Fiat currencies. It has a desire to replace a lot, if not all of the functions that Fiat currencies have.
- Ethereum has more ambitious desires than Bitcoin, to become a global decentralized blockchain with general compute, rather than just a global currency. Ironically, Ethereum is currency the best example of a working decentralized currency. In its current form it is being used for over $20 million in transaction fees. A lot of this is derived from the success of NFTs, which have went mainstream and brought in a large new group of people in cryptocurrency.
- There are many other cryptocurrencies that are competing directly with Ethereum and Bitcoin, and we will speak of some of them here.

### Fiat
I will only mention the massive problems that exist with the global Fiat system, to remind us how we got here in the first place:

- The United States Federal Reserve and the Federal Government work in conjunction to control the economy through a lot of levers. The main lever is controlling the lending rate. They can do other things, such as purchase assets on the open market, which they did for COVID. But we can focus on the lending rate here.
- With Global Trade today, this one small lever has an incredible amount of influence over the entire world economy. It can hurt and harm many people across the world who have no business in caring what the US governments current financial situation is. 
- The system is quite complex, and ends up lending itself to benefits those who understand it well, and are close to the top of the foodchain. It is most evident in the 2008 financial crisis, where the juxtaposition of Bankers getting multi-million dollar bonuses, while middle-class Americans saw their savings wiped out, and sevearly damage some families abilities to provide for themselves.
- The system is broken. It has been stretched beyond its limits since 2008, and after COVID I would argue that there is 100% certainty it no longer works in it's current form. It fucks over 99% of the people, and benefits the 1% who are privledged, or who are lucky enough to have studied it, and exploited it for themselves.
- It's not just the United States - but the whole Fiat system. Basically every other government faces the same issues. Only they are in a weaker position because they are not the global reserve currency. The US is in an extreme position of power, as they can print as many dollars as they'd like.

The system cannot be fixed and reprogrammed to work. It has to be replaced by something completely new.
### Bitcoin
There is a common path many people follow with Bitcoin:
- They hear of it, buy it, and go down the rabbit hole.
- After a while, they start to believe it is dinosaur technology, and has lost it's narrative.
- After a longer while, they realize the beauty and strength in it's simplicity. And they come full circle and realize Bitcoin is something they have to own.

Bitcoin as a whole, is the most decentralized currency. It is 100% the only currency worth holding if you need to escape from your country fast, with nothing but a backpack and a laptop. 

It solves a lot of problems, but it doesn't solve all problems. This is why it's narrative has changed over the years. (INSERT THAT PHOTO FROM NICK CARTER?)

Digital gold is the latest narrative that has stuck around. And it very well could be the endgame for Bitcoin.

Points to add:
- directly attached to the production of energy. makes it extremely flexible
- there really isn't a single person who can pull levers, it is as stable as possible
- the miners have some power, and mining is somewhat centralized, but they are also in a dilemma, where if they do greedy things, the price of bitcoin will decrease
- Naturally has wide distribution, although it has benefitted early adopters, who go on to contribute nothing (see, not perfect)
- I feel like I am missing 1 or 2 here.


### Ethereum
Points to add
- It is being used like crazy
- Has had a wide distribution due to very early ICO. Getting more widespread with the success of NFTs and DeFi. A wide array of people have now held it
- These two above mentions make it useful money
- It is way more complex than bitcoin
- It is much more than just digital gold. It is a global community. It is a compute network
- Not everything will run on Ethereum. But it appears it might be the global settlement layer - a la L2's and sidechains. (This is it's current narrative. Like bitcoin, the narrative is always changing)

### Liquity Protocol and LUSD
Point to Add
  - A Stablecoin, LUSD, that is backed by one single collateral, which is ETH. Simplicity
  - LQTY - token that absorbs the fees of the network. The fees are mint and burn fees (TODO - are there more? I don't think so).
  - The risk is global, the repayments are global
    - Repay the worst tranch can be done by anyone
  - It is really an ethereum derivative. Which is what makes ETH as an asset so cool. It has built in programmability. Which lends to ETH being more like money.
  - 110% collateral
  - 150% Safety zone (TODO - define better)
### Frax
Frax is one of the most interesting cryptocurrenices in action today (Q1 2022). It has innovated, and has gained traction as a popular stablecoin, and the project is executing well. It states directly in its [documentation](https://docs.frax.finance/) that it would like to replace Bitcoin. 

Here is Frax at a high level:
- It is backed by real collateral, and but it is also backed by an algorithm. Thus it is a fractional-algorithm (i.e. FRAX) stablecoin.
- Two Tokens – FRAX is the stablecoin targeting a tight band around $1/coin. Frax Shares (FXS) is the governance token which accrues fees, seigniorage revenue, and excess collateral value.
- It has one major lever - adjusting the collateral ratio. At 100% CR, it is backed by real collateral. At 80% CR, it is backed by 80% real collateral, and 20% algorithmically backed.
- It isn't technically under-collaterlized at all. To mint FRAX at 80% CR, you need 80% USDC and 20%.
- If FRAX is trading at above $1, the protocol decreases the collateral ratio. If FRAX is trading at under $1, the protocol increases the collateral ratio. 
- It has done a pretty good job at being governance minimized.
  - Parameters that are up for governance through FXS include adding/adjusting collateral pools, adjusting various fees (like minting or redeeming), and refreshing the rate of the collateral ratio. No other actions such as active management of collateral or addition of human-modifiable parameters are possible other than a hardfork that would require voluntarily moving to a new implementation entirely.

- It has a decentralization ratio measure, where the assets that back FRAX are measured YES or NO as decentarlized, and then added up to see how much of the colalteral is backed by a decentralized asset.
- it is kind of like a central bank with the AMOS
- it is a community of investors.
- veFXS
  - Lock up your FXS, get veFXS
  - Get AMO profits above the collateral ratio
  - 50% of profits are used to buy back FXS and burn it. The other 50% goes to veFXS holders


Frax is nowhere near the be all end all. But it has succeeded where other Algo backed stable coins have failed (LINKS?)

Anyways, frax is like something we have never seen before. decentralized, currency creation. an output that is proving to be fruitful. very low governance. the output is votable - how to spend money, how to mint more. but these are assets under control of the DAO. the general protocol is low governance. which is great for soneone just holding frax

## Local currencies (TODO, link to Ethans blogs)
Points to make
- A lot of this has been from my reading of Ethan Buchmans blog. I am still very new to this whole idea of currency. I have read about it over the years and it didn't really click. But this time around it did. I believe with conviction, this will be big. 
- People are building communities already (link to tucker). I think this is step 1
- Closed Loop
  - Meaning that exchanging goods, services, and money can be kept within the community
- Stability
  - **Local currency should be resistant to outside policy, effects, decisions, and attacks.**
  - Is it possible that Stablility should not even be expected of a Network currency? Well maybe. Maybe bitcoin is the best we will ever get. But I think you should focus on the stability from within first, rather than relay on stability from the outskirts.
- reciprocity, redistribution, house-holding, exchange (they build on each other in that order)
  - three still found in families, friends, orgs, communities, indiginous tribes,
  - We can see some very early processes playing out in crypto. Airdrops are an example of redistribution. Same with community treasuries. 
- Concepts
  - ragequitting helps with the two way street. but part of the two way street is that the communities joining need to be subject to some fault and risk as well.
  - take 100 of your LOCAL coin. Agree to swap your real world for 500 LOCAL coin in future. thus brining you into the system
    - only way to exit the system, is fees
    - maybe you can use locking mechanisms here
- credit clearing
  - obviously very good at both levels
  - but extremely good and very implementable at local levels
  - your friends, parents, barber, butcher, grocer, barista, personal trainer, favorite restaurant
    - clearly very bad for tracking taxes (but that is a topic for a different day)
- Will probably cause problems for collecting taxes



## Bridging Local and Network Currencies
- Building a single way for local currencies to opt upwards into the algo-stablecoin. so that many can do it at once.
- **I think this will be a very important area, which today is completely unexplored, due to there being very little existing local currencies.**
- Bridging the gap seems like a very big deal because local communities will have economic output, and they will want to exchange their local output for global assets.
  - Of course they could just exchange it for Bitcoin, and then bridge into the world with that.
  - **but I believe many local currencies will want some reputation that is recognized by the greater community. their currency will be a way to represent legitimacy**
  - This brings me to a point that Balaji made - that cities will have city coins, which can be used to invest, speculate, and transact within a city. Historically, real estate has been the represetative way to invest in a city and it's growth. Decoupling speculations from home ownership will be a massive win for many global cities around the world. Toronto, where I live, has been victim to foreign speculators buying up condos, and local investors owning multiple properties and charging rent. 
  - A city with it's own currency has incredible opportunity. Startup cities will become real - where we see small cities take advantage of this and grow. There are also big cities like Miami that seem like they could execute building their own token.
- Local currencies will need to follow some sort of standard. ERC-20 standard is for a basic token. But a local currency might want to even run its own network of nodes. Cosmos is well positioned to be infrastructure that powers this.
- Once there is a standard for Local Currencies that gains traction, there will be a clear opportunity of how to bridge them to the Network Currencies.
- 

## Conclusion
- Local currencies will aim to be more stable, network currencies aim for growth.
- Most people will be transacting with one major local currency and one major network currency.   
- Network currencies will always be battling each other. It is a battleground. 
  - I think there is argument to be made that the concept of a world reserve currency might actually disapear, rather than the USA lose it to some other country.
- Local currencies are going to grow. Probably a bit slow. There isn't immediate possibility for it to grow at expoential rates.
- Local currencies enable closed loop and circular ecnomics more easily, and credit clearing
- The bridging between local and network will be a big opportunity.
