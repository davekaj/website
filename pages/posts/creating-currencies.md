# Creating Currencies

- Frax
  - frax is one of hte most interesting projects in the space i see today
  - it is executing on FRAX. Why?
    - absorbed 2 billion
    - minted 2.4 billion (or whatever, 15% more)
    - create a demand for FXS (buy and burn) to mint FRAX
    - to burn frax you get in return FXS and FRAX. then its mint and sell the FXS to fully collateralize yourself
    - it is a community
  - yet it is a community of investors. a hedge fund. (or possible they are trying to be their own central bank? I need to read this)
  - key features
    - governance minimized
      - Parameters that are up for governance through FXS include adding/adjusting collateral pools, adjusting various fees (like minting or redeeming), and refreshing the rate of the collateral ratio. No other actions such as active management of collateral or addition of human-modifiable parameters are possible other than a hardfork that would require voluntarily moving to a new implementation entirely.
    - AMOs
      - this is where you see what it is, a community that enables this as their output. it gives it meaning
  - The fees it gives you, are revenue
  - veFXS
  - *** Anyways, frax is like something we have never seen before. decentralized, currency creation. an output that is proving to be fruitful. very low governance. the output is votable - how to spend money, how to mint more. but these are assets under control of the DAO. the general protocol is low governance. which is great for soneone just holding frax
  - the question is the FRAX token. it is highly volatile and a lot of the action is tied up in it
    - this is where it goes against CLOSED LOOP.


- Local currencies
  - closed loop 
  - reciprocity, redistribution, house-holding, exchange (they build on each other in that order)
    - three still found in families, friends, orgs, communities, indiginous tribes,
    - QUESTION - can these be replicated in FRAX?
      - we do see FRAX working with other protocols, in good faith and in good operation
  - take 100 of your LOCAL coin. Agree to swap your real world for 500 LOCAL coin in future. thus brining you into the system
    - only way to exit the system, is fees
    - maybe you can use locking mechaisms here
  - i had some thoughts around deposit, get undercollateralized loan, or get interest


- FEI, LUSD, DAI, ?? Terra or MIM, mention?



- So at what scale do all of these things work?
  - Your family scale works well. lots of trust
  - FRAX is simple and good, but what has it optimized for? Maybe I should draw an image
    - its medium size -ish. lots of simplicity does it well
  - So I pose a few questions....
    - Do we want to scale out horizontally, smaller, tighter knit, closed loops, less "data" and "safety" i.e. scores
    - or continually grow out, with scores (like a credit score, but of course a credit source is also imperfect. its generalized to fit the mold of all users, and obviously looses some quality in the numbers because of this) - and allow something like frax to GROW.
    - I would say......... both.
      - Horizontally, we also need a trust score of the components. the internet of blockchains..... needs to be comparable
