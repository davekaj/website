# Local Currencies and Network Currencies (Still a Draft)

(TODO - better intro sentence)
Local Currencies are an underdeveloped field in the cryptocurrency space that I believe will have more significance over the next 5 years. Most of the development in cryptocurrencies we have seen are around "Network Currencies". Let us describe the two types of currencies:

- Network Currency - A currency that is used by a large, diverse group of individuals or organizations. It is built to benefit from network effects, and wants to grow at scale, as it becomes more useful as more people us it. It will sacrifice stability to obtain growth.
- Local Currency - A currency that is used by a small, well defined group of individuals or organizations. It is built to a defined limit, and once it reaches that limit, it does not have a desire to grow. It will sacrifice growth to obtain stability.

As you can see, they are designed to be complete opposites of each other. 

In the 20th and 21st century, we have been conditioned to only trade, barter and exchange in Network Currencies. This has come about through the modernization of the global economy, countries taking a more centralized and more significant role in our lives, ultimately leading to a total dependency on Fiat Currencies (USD, CAD, GBP, etc.).

What this means is we have all been forced into economies that fluctuate with instability that is 100% outside of our control. We are going through a particularly instable and turbulent time in the 2020's, which was kicked into high gear by the COVID crisis. We are going to see more instability in the coming years, and it won't be pretty.

We need both stability and growth in life and the economy. I will make a point here - that we should split up these two desire in economics into the two different currencies. Of course you can have some growth within a Local Currency, and some stability in a Network Currency, but I believe Local should optimize for stability, and Network for growth.

We should also split up examples where you would expect to use a Local Currency and a Network Currency:

**Local Currency**
- Immediate Family and Friends.
- Your local neighbourhood.
- Your town or city.
- A city or town that you visit. Likely you can use a Network Currency to transact there, but you might pay an extra fee. If you stay long enough, you might want to opt into their system, if they allow it.
- A clan or DAO currency in the Metaverse. (Local Currency will exist in physical space, as well as digital).


**Network Currency**
- State
- Country
- Global. Although there are a lot of problems with Fiat currency, there are some good things. Having the USD as the global reserve currency removes a lot of friction to international trade. Everyone can benchmark against the USD, and it creates a global story we can all follow and organize around. Having similar features in cryptocurrencies is highly desirable. There are a lot of transactions you will do that need to use a Network Currency, and the person you are interacting with will have never heard of your favorite Local Currency.

I'd like to make a point that the average person only needs to interact with one Local Currency and one Network Currency. There will likely be millions of Local Currencies, and Thousands of Network Currencies. Yet the average person will only need 1 of each. You need both. You need to interact with a Local currency in order to be able to have stability and reliability within your community, and be able to transact with peace of mind. You will want access to a Network Currency for growth potential, but also as a hedge to your own Local Currency failing.

The lines also aren't set in stone. A large enough city could end up having a network currency, and a small enough state could have a Local Currency. These are just guidelines to paint the picture.

The point I want to get across in this blog is that we will need both Local and Network Currencies, and that blockchains are going to facilitate this. I believe the Local Currencies are more important to build, foster, and champion because we already have Network Currencies being worked on - pretty much every blockchain that is well known is a Network Currency.

Let's dig into the Network Currency landscape today.
## Network Currencies
Yo

### Bitcoin

### Ethereum
### Frax
- Frax
  - frax is one of hte most interesting projects in the space i see today
  - it is executing on FRAX. Why?
    - absorbed 2 billion
    - minted 2.4 billion (or whatever, 15% more)
    - create a demand for FXS (buy and burn) to mint FRAX
    - to burn frax you get in return FXS and FRAX. then its mint and sell the FXS to fully collateralize yourself
    - it is a community
  - yet it is a community of investors. a hedge fund. (or possible they are trying to be their own central bank? I need to read this)
  - key features
    - governance minimized
      - Parameters that are up for governance through FXS include adding/adjusting collateral pools, adjusting various fees (like minting or redeeming), and refreshing the rate of the collateral ratio. No other actions such as active management of collateral or addition of human-modifiable parameters are possible other than a hardfork that would require voluntarily moving to a new implementation entirely.
    - AMOs
      - this is where you see what it is, a community that enables this as their output. it gives it meaning
  - The fees it gives you, are revenue
  - veFXS
  - *** Anyways, frax is like something we have never seen before. decentralized, currency creation. an output that is proving to be fruitful. very low governance. the output is votable - how to spend money, how to mint more. but these are assets under control of the DAO. the general protocol is low governance. which is great for soneone just holding frax
  - the question is the FRAX token. it is highly volatile and a lot of the action is tied up in it
    - this is where it goes against CLOSED LOOP.
  - The DR (decentralized ratio) is great too


## LUSD
- LUSD
  - LUSD is like a recursive currency that uses the LUSD to stabalize the debt even more. Really it is protecting the protocol as much as possible to prevent going below 110%
  - I forget, but it seems that the 150% is the real mark. although probably there is no penalty. 
  - what they do is they allow the worst lender to always get auto-cashed out. their debt is paid down, and what they receive is the leftover ETH. so if they were 160%, the lowest, someone pays them down, well they keep whatever their LUSD was they withdrew early. and get repaid the 60% extra in ETH, for them to claim later. 
  - So the risk is global, the repayments are global, the situation is simple

## Local currencies (TODO, link to Ethans blogs)
- closed loop 
- **Local currency should be resistant to outside policy, effects, decisions, and attacks.**
  - Is it possible that Stablility should not even be expected of a Network currency? Well maybe. Maybe bitcoin is the best we will ever get. But I think you should focus on the stability from within first, rather than relay on stability from the outskirts.
- reciprocity, redistribution, house-holding, exchange (they build on each other in that order)
  - three still found in families, friends, orgs, communities, indiginous tribes,
- Concepts
  - ragequitting helps with the two way street. but part of the two way street is that the communities joining need to be subject to some fault and risk as well.
  - take 100 of your LOCAL coin. Agree to swap your real world for 500 LOCAL coin in future. thus brining you into the system
    - only way to exit the system, is fees
    - maybe you can use locking mechanisms here
- credit clearing
  - obviously very good at both levels
  - but extremely good and very implementable at local levels
  - your friends, parents, barber, butcher, grocer, barista, personal trainer, favorite restaurant
    - clearly very bad for tracking taxes (but that is a topic for a different day)

## Making a point that you will likely want to participate in 1 of each, and that is probably enough for everyone. But most of us have been forced into a single network currency for many decades.
- You'll always want to consistently exit a system that you are not a part of, or not well represented in.
- Especially if we can make an infinite amount of economies, tokens, monies, etc. 
- We often think of money and currencies in a finite design space. Countries (which control violence, and before that empires, states, the church, etc.) determine currency. We also have commodities, and other rare metals that can be treated as currency. 
  - But now the design space is wide open.
- **So I think we will opt into large currencies yes. But we also need to opt into local currencies that are so close to what we are doing, that decisions we make directly effect us and the people we interact with on a daily basis. This currency might very well be for the physical world, or the digital world.**


## Bridging Local and Network Currencies
- Building a single way for local currencies to opt upwards into the algo-stablecoin. so that many can do it at once.

# Summary Points / Conclusion
- a


# Not sure if it will fit in
- Scores (a bit too specific?)
  - Two types of scores
    - local scores
    - global scores
  - WHAT IF YOU COULD PLEDGE SCORES. FIRST YOU START WITH RECIPROCITY.
    - I know greg markou. heâ€™s a good guy. I give him some of my earned score. overtime, this is reciprocity spreading throughout the score
    - then we hit a mark where we have to redistribute the scores. the people who have a lot must distribute, or have it burnt. we start again, and bring in more people this time. we give them scores.
    - we do this continually until we hit (3). which is where small groups of people (families, friends, in both cases 3 to 10 people) are self sustaining in their financial situation.
    - once there is trust within the system, we begin to take interact with this trust in the outer world, effectively trading it, by allowing groups to take on fractionalized loans, or undercollateralized loans.
  - If I don't bring in scores, I will probably bring in the concept of TRUST at both levels. 
    - the governemnt naturally wanted to do everything for us. now we are realizing we should be self sustainable.
