# Community Currencies and Network Currencies (Still a Draft)
TODO - is Community Currency better? (95% sure it is)

What is most under discussed aspect of blockchains and cryptocurrencies, that have the biggest opportunity to change the global financial system?

Well, that my friends, is Community Currencies.

Community Currencies will change the fundamental operation of our global economy - yet it is largely ignored in the current narrative and conversations of crypto.

Why has it been ignored? Mostly due to incentives - which has driven 99% of people to pay attention to "Network Currencies" (as I call them). We'll get into more details on why Community Currencies are so important, but first let's explain the two types:

- *Network Currency* - A currency that is used by a large, diverse group of individuals or organizations. **It is built to benefit from network effects, and wants to grow at all costs, as it becomes more useful as more people us it. It will sacrifice stability to obtain growth.**
- *Community Currency* - A currency that is used by a small, well defined group of individuals or organizations. It is built to have a limit to it's size and usage, and once it reaches that limit, it does not have a desire to grow. It will sacrifice growth to obtain stability. A Community Currency MAY or MAY NOT look exactly like currency as we understand it today. It could be closer to a reputation, a score, or even some sort of metaverse / video game gold.

As you can see, they are more or less opposites of each other. 

In the 20th and 21st century, we have been conditioned to only trade, barter and exchange in Network Currencies. This has come about through the modernization of the global economy. Countries took a centralized role in our lives, and completely monopolized the economy for themselves. This ultimately lead to a total dependency on Fiat Currencies (USD, CAD, GBP, etc.) - and eventually to the Global, interconnected economy we have today.

What this means is we have all been forced into economies that fluctuate with instability that is 100% outside of our control. We are going through a particularly instable and turbulent time in the 2020's, which was kicked into high gear by the COVID crisis, and even War. We are likely to see more instability for the next few years.

**And this is where cryptocurrency comes into play. I believe cryptocurrency will allow us to separate economic growth to mainly occur in Network Currencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, that directly compete with Fiat currencies. And I believe cryptocurrencies will also allow Community Currencies to flourish, and have a renassance of small, Community economies that are resistant to outside, global fluctuations.**

To focus further, I believe we should organize cryptocurrencies into three categories:

- Decentralized Network Currencies (i.e. Bitcoin, Ether) - These are in direct competition with Fiat Currencies. A world changing technology that will change global economics.
- Centralized Network Currencies (i.e. Crypto Fintech / Open Wall Street) - A lot of cryptocurrencies as mascaquarding as Decentralized, yet are far from it, and their core algorithms and designs trend towards more centralization. This has largely been ignored for the bull market of 2020-2021, but will increase in discussion in the next bear market. HOWEVER - one thing that is not talked about is that these cryptos can still lead to successful products. "Crypto Fintech" is an exit from legacy financial systems, into new and improved open techonology that was build as a by-product of excitment in decentralized cryptocurrencies. The first wave of "Fintech" didn't really change much because they have to operate within existing legal frameworks, and they were unable to change the system. Today we have Centralized Network Currencies like $BNB and $FTX. Both of these Centralized exchanges are on paths to become global banks, with global customers. I would bet they both have a market cap larger than every bank in the world within 5 years.
- Decentralized Community Currencies - Community Currencies can operate as decentralized. It would allow Community communities to build bridges of trust upwards and downwards to Network Currencies. It is still vague how these bridges will be built and how the trust will be transferred between Community and global communities - but it will be built through a bottom up, trial and error process. Any centralized planning is likely to fail.
- Centralized Community Currencies - A Centralized Community Currency is a perfectly good use case for open finance technology. There is no harm in having a Proof of Authority (POA) network for a village or city of less than 10,000 people. There are likely societal power dynamics that cannot be replaced by software, and thus there is no reason to build a decentralized system. It is more likely this would work in a system that is meant to mainly focus on trust within the community, rather than a Community Currency that is designed to bridge trust to other communities. The open technology being built will allow for small communities to easily adopt the techonology to build their own system.

TODO - continue here. it is a very good intro and explanation above

In 5 years, the majority of people will be interacting with Community Currencies and Network Currencies simultaneously. The days where we used to be locked into using a single currency - our own countries Fiat, will be long gone.

> Note - this section below is old world, that I am likely to keep.

**Community Currency**
- Immediate Family and Friends.
- Your Community neighbourhood.
- Your town or city.
- A city or town that you visit. Likely you can use a Network Currency to transact there, but you might pay an extra fee. If you stay long enough, you might want to opt into their system, if they allow it.
- A clan or DAO currency in the Metaverse. (Community Currency will exist in physical space, as well as digital).


**Network Currency**
- State
- Country
- Global. Although there are a lot of problems with Fiat currency, there are some good things. Having the USD as the global reserve currency removes a lot of friction to international trade. Everyone can benchmark against the USD, and it creates a global story we can all follow and organize around. Having similar features in cryptocurrencies is highly desirable. There are a lot of transactions you will do that need to use a Network Currency, and the person you are interacting with will have never heard of your favorite Community Currency.

I'd like to make a point that the average person only needs to interact with one Community Currency and one Network Currency. There will likely be millions of Community Currencies, and Thousands of Network Currencies. Yet the average person will only need 1 of each. You need both. You need to interact with a Community currency in order to be able to have stability and reliability within your community, and be able to transact with peace of mind. You will want access to a Network Currency for growth potential, but also as a hedge to your own Community Currency failing.

The lines also aren't set in stone. A large enough city could end up having a network currency, and a small enough state could have a Community Currency. These are just guidelines to paint the picture.

The point I want to get across in this blog is that we will need both Community and Network Currencies, and that blockchains are going to facilitate this. I believe the Community Currencies are more important to build, foster, and champion because we already have Network Currencies being worked on - pretty much every blockchain that is well known is a Network Currency.

Let's dig into the Network Currency landscape today.
## Network Currencies
Much has been written about Fiat Currencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum. So I will only briefly touch on these topics. One point to take away about the network currencies is that they are competing with each other directly. For example:

- USD is the global reserve currency. All other currencies compete with it in some way. The only other Fiat currency that is competing to be a global reserve currency today is the Chinese Yuan.
- Bitcoin is competing with all Fiat currencies. It has a desire to replace a lot, if not all of the functions that Fiat currencies have.
- Ethereum has more ambitious desires than Bitcoin, to become a global decentralized blockchain with general compute, rather than just a global currency. Ironically, Ethereum is currency the best example of a working decentralized currency. In its current form it is being used for over $20 million in transaction fees. A lot of this is derived from the success of NFTs, which have went mainstream and brought in a large new group of people in cryptocurrency.
- There are many other cryptocurrencies that are competing directly with Ethereum and Bitcoin, and we will speak of some of them here.




## Community currencies (TODO, link to Ethans blogs)
### Points to make on Ethans Blog
- A lot of this has been from my reading of Ethan Buchmans blog. I am still very new to this whole idea of currency. I have read about it over the years and it didn't really click. But this time around it did. I believe with conviction, this will be big. 
- People are building communities already (link to tucker). I think this is step 1
- Closed Loop
  - Meaning that exchanging goods, services, and money can be kept within the community
- Stability
  - **Community currency should be resistant to outside policy, effects, decisions, and attacks.**
  - Is it possible that Stablility should not even be expected of a Network currency? Well maybe. Maybe bitcoin is the best we will ever get. But I think you should focus on the stability from within first, rather than relay on stability from the outskirts.
- reciprocity, redistribution, house-holding, exchange (they build on each other in that order)
  - three still found in families, friends, orgs, communities, indiginous tribes,
  - We can see some very early processes playing out in crypto. Airdrops are an example of redistribution. Same with community treasuries. 
- Concepts
  - ragequitting helps with the two way street. but part of the two way street is that the communities joining need to be subject to some fault and risk as well.
  - take 100 of your Community coin. Agree to swap your real world for 500 Community coin in future. thus brining you into the system
    - only way to exit the system, is fees
    - maybe you can use locking mechanisms here
- credit clearing
  - obviously very good at both levels
  - but extremely good and very implementable at Community levels
  - your friends, parents, barber, butcher, grocer, barista, personal trainer, favorite restaurant
    - clearly very bad for tracking taxes (but that is a topic for a different day)
- Will probably cause problems for collecting taxes

### Grassroots Economics and Others
- https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/pages/about-us.html
  - CIC currencies
  - 5 Pesas
  - the 5 pesas went up to **SARAFU-CREDIT**
  - i am pretty sure SARAFU credit can be exchanged for kenyan shillings
  - [http://sustainablecity.org/articles/roots.htm](http://sustainablecity.org/articles/roots.htm)
  - link to Ethan

### Citycoins.co
- **[https://www.citycoins.co/](https://www.citycoins.co/)**
    - **i am almost certain this will be included and I MUST ADD MORE HERE RESEARCH THIS FUCK MORE REEARCH**
    - **it works with STX…. GOOD POINT - i think this is quite key.. BTC IS GOOD**
    - **interestingly…. VERY interestingly, the economic model does not depend on any government support**
    - not necessarily the best design, but its somewhere to start!

###
### Personal Points to make
- Most Community currencies we see today are for online communities
- We are starting to see physical - Community currencies created
  - ETH Denver Spork
    - https://medium.com/ethdenver/sporkdao-token-economics-spork-rewards-5d0c1aaa0ba6 - this is actually a very good blog. Now, $SPORK looks pretty small right now, but can it become a triving community? Perhaps it becomes the driving force behind making Denver a global Blockchain Hub. It has already brought likely millions of  dollars in tourism for Denver.
  - ETH Denver food tokens
    - A small example. But food vendors and people loved this. It exists for 4 days and then becomes useless. However, maybe in 2023, $SPORK can be used to pay for food 
- We are going to see physical communities from scratch that are even bigger
  - Tucker Max - Full out self sustaining communities.
    - Although an extreme viewpoint which I don't fully agree will happen - I still 100% agree with his concept of living back in a simpler, more natural community, that is self sustaining.
  - CityDAO - in wyoming
    - Crypto cities will look both like large ranches that band together to protect each other.
    - As well as cheap, portable housing that can create startup cities super fast.

## What can Communties do to build with this stuff?
- TODO - Crypto cities vitalik
  - Not only Community coins.... but local Governments too!
    - ownership (land)
    - business registration
    - voting and governance
    - identity
    - GIVE A LINK TO VITALIKS BLOG
  - NOTE - this is where the TOOLS below come in. So fit that in.
- We will give them basic tools to build these currencies in a plug and play manner. Creating a Community currency will be as easy as creating a Shopify Store.
- Tools
  - Cosmos - by nature no buy in. permissionless, not judgemental bridges. bottom up
  - DeFi Primitives
    - Bonding Curves
    - Algo borrow and lending rates
    - Easilt deployable NFTs and ERC20s
    - Staking
  - Governance Primitives
    - Voting, quadratic voting
  - Privacy 
  - Identities
  - Tax collection & accounting.
- These tools will be built, and will be built upon for open source Community organization. 
- Communities will be brought into the digital age with this.
- This will also be adopted by larger entities, like cities, who want to streamline their organizations. Having these stanards built across the world will create for human efficiencies, and save us millions of hours of time.




## Bridging Community and Network Currencies
- IBC is likely the best thing to use for this.
- Building a single way for Community currencies to opt upwards into the algo-stablecoin. so that many can do it at once.
- **I think this will be a very important area, which today is completely unexplored, due to there being very little existing Community currencies.**
- Bridging the gap seems like a very big deal because local communities will have economic output, and they will want to exchange their Community output for global assets.
  - Of course they could just exchange it for Bitcoin, and then bridge into the world with that.
  - **but I believe many Community currencies will want some reputation that is recognized by the greater community. their currency will be a way to represent legitimacy**
  - This brings me to a point that Balaji made - that cities will have city coins, which can be used to invest, speculate, and transact within a city. Historically, real estate has been the represetative way to invest in a city and it's growth. Decoupling speculations from home ownership will be a massive win for many global cities around the world. Toronto, where I live, has been victim to foreign speculators buying up condos, and Community investors owning multiple properties and charging rent. 
  - A city with it's own currency has incredible opportunity. Startup cities will become real - where we see small cities take advantage of this and grow. There are also big cities like Miami that seem like they could execute building their own token.
- Community currencies will need to follow some sort of standard. ERC-20 standard is for a basic token. But a Community currency might want to even run its own network of nodes. Cosmos is well positioned to be infrastructure that powers this.
- Once there is a standard for Community Currencies that gains traction, there will be a clear opportunity of how to bridge them to the Network Currencies.

## Conclusion
> Note on fiat to close to fit in nicely - We know the global Fiat system, and monetary governing bodies around the world, are broken. They are lead us from crisis to crisis, with complete inability to stabalilze the economy. Since 2008 this has been evidently clear, and only continue to get worse. Bitcoin has given us a starting point, leading to many decentralized network currencies. And now we will build out Community Currencies to completely change the way we interact. To a way that is more stable, and understandable, for our tiny human brains.

- Community currencies are being ignored for now, but will change the world
  - they dont fix everything, they are not a panacea. but they will change a lot
- Community currencies will aim to be more stable, network currencies aim for growth.
- Community currencies are going to grow. Probably a bit slow. There isn't immediate possibility for it to grow at expoential rates.
- Community currencies enable closed loop and circular ecnomics more easily, and credit clearing
  - this is a way we can fundamentally improve the world economy to look more natural.
- OPEN QUESTION - The bridging between Community and network will be a big opportunity.
- OPEN QUESTIONS maybe to include
  - will they look fundamentally different at different sizes? (NNT)
    - Or can a cosmos chain just be used for netowrk and community currencies
