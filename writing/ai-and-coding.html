    <h1>AI and Coding</h1>
    <em>March 2024</em>
    <p>It's extremely clear that AI is going to change how software developers work, forever. I don't think there has
      ever been such an aggressive improvement in the way that someone can do their job. I still don't think that it
      will replace software jobs entirely.</p>
    <p>How developers will ultimately use it - The thing is, these models need to be trained, and they also need someone
      to direct them on what to do. They do make an individual developer very powerful. You can learn a new language a
      lot quicker, and you can write boilerplate code in seconds. If you can break up your large coding task into small
      pieces, it's likely you can get ChatGPT to write 80% of your code, while you just patch it up and integrate it to
      the rest of your code. But it can't write you a project from scratch. It can't create a startup from scratch. It
      can't maintain a database to have 99.99% uptime, and be on call for the 0.01% everything crashes and your
      customers are screaming at you. Ultimately I believe it will make bad developers OK, good developers great, and
      great developers legendary. But I don't think it will change much in the nature of companies that are changing the
      world, or even change the world that much from a coding perspective. It will make things much more efficient, and
      with that we will produce more code, and write more software. But there is a limit to useful software. In the way
      that we travel, by foot, bike, car, boat, train and plane, we have really optimized these things to the max. We
      are innovating in areas like space travel, and thus I think the same thing will happen in software. Web
      development is going to be so easy with AI </p>
    <p>How it will grow and improve - Will LLMs I think we will quickly hit an S-curve in terms of it improving itself.
      I belive it can and will get better at some prompting in the next 1-2 years, and then it will level out. I
      actually think the limiting factoring is going to be the ability of the person using it to prompt it correctly,
      and use the AI to build incredible things. AI is extremely cheap for anyone to use, it is a supercomputer brain
      that can think at the speed and work at the speed that 1000 humans couldn't do. Yet, if you don't know what to
      tell it, or how to ask what you want to build, it will literally do 1000x the work for the completely wrong thing.
      I think we are going to be much more limited in not using the tool correctly, compared to being limited in
      improving the techonology so that it can do more for us. </p>
    <p>It is also not clear to me what AI technology beyond LMMs will come, and potentially change the landscape. I am
      not well versed in the technolgy of AI, as I have spent my entire career working in crypto. It is of course
      concievable that we will come up with something even better than LLMs. At which point I would have to adjust my
      above thesis. But for now, I think it is likely AI will mostly be a tool that gives developers super powers,
      rather than making anyone be able to write code.</p>
    <p>What are the best ones? - I genuinely want to know this question, and I want to research it.</p>
    <p>I do think in general that this is going to make software developers even worse than they are today. The job is
      being dumbed down, and there are developers today who are learning how to code from day 1 with an LLM. Of course,
      you can also argue that the developers of the 2000's and the 2010's were worse than the pioneers in the
      1970s-1990's. Before the internet, developers had to read books on coding, and learn in a very small environemnt.
      They were more likely to understand the hardware too, and understand low level computing. It is no doubt that a C
      developer > Javascript developer > ChatGPT prompter / developer. Yet ultimately, there have always been people who
      are bad at their job. It follows a bell curve. There were bad C developers in the 1970's. </p>
